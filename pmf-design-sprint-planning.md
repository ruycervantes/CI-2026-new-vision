# PMF & Design Sprint Planning

**Created:** Jan 15, 2026
**Context:** Discussion during action items cleanup session with Claude Code

---

## The Challenge

- Need to run design sprint (remote, accelerated) this or next sprint
- Chicken-egg problem:
  - Design sprint needs inputs (user insights, hypotheses)
  - User research needs focus (what are we trying to learn?)
  - PMF validation needs definition (which customer segment?)
- Leo has access to customers (current clients, prospects, friends)
- Need access to potential users (not just customers)
- Want to validate multiple customer segments at once

---

## Proposed Sequence

```
1. Define customer segments for PMF (with Leo, ~1 hour)
   ↓
2. Design the design sprint (Ruy, 2-3 hours)
   - Decide: pure design sprint vs hybrid with research
   - Decide: which Q1 features to focus on
   ↓
3. Run accelerated design sprint (2-3 days)
   - Day 1: User research / insights gathering
   - Day 2: Ideate + prototype
   - Day 3: Validate with users/customers
```

## Customer Segments for PMF

| Segment | Access via | What to validate |
|---------|------------|------------------|
| L&D buyers (enterprise) | Leo - current clients | Will they pay for behavior change beyond courses? |
| HR/managers | Leo - prospects | Is "personal trainer for work" compelling? |
| Individual users | Potential users (Peppe, etc.) | Does the product stick without corporate mandate? |
| Coaches | Horacio | Would they use this as a tool? |

**Open question:** Which 1-2 segments to focus Q1?

**Key distinction:**
- **Customers** = validate willingness to pay
- **Users** = validate usability and value

---

## Design Sprint Options

| Format | Duration | Best for |
|--------|----------|----------|
| Classic GV | 5 days | Full team, in-person, complex problems |
| Accelerated/remote | 3 days | Small team, remote, focused scope |
| Hybrid (SVC-style) | 3 days | When user research is needed upfront |

**Leaning toward:** Hybrid - includes user research in Day 1, then ideate/prototype/validate.

---

## PMF Process (Simple, Ongoing)

```
Segment → Hypothesis → Test → Learn → Iterate
    ↑___________________________________|
```

**Create once, run continuously:**
1. Pick a segment
2. State hypothesis (what do we believe?)
3. Design test (interview, prototype, MVP)
4. Run test, capture learnings
5. Update hypothesis, repeat

**Living doc:** Update after each validation cycle.

## Validation Questions by Segment

### L&D Buyers (Enterprise)
- Will they pay for behavior change beyond courses?
- Do they see value in "application coaching"?
- What metrics do they need to justify purchase?

### HR/Managers
- Is "personal trainer for work" compelling?
- Would they recommend to their teams?
- What would they pay for it?

### Individual Users
- Does the product stick without corporate mandate?
- What makes them come back?
- Voice vs chat preference?

### Coaches
- Would they use this as a tool?
- Does it complement or compete with their work?

---

## Specific Questions to Validate (from earlier discussions)

- Would customers buy "application coaching" sessions?
- Voice vs Bidirectional Teams chatbot - which first?
- Does the vision resonate vs competitors?
- Are we differentiated from habit apps? (Oseas concern)
- Are we 80/20 replaceable by a $10 app?

---

## Next Steps

See action items: `action-items-ruy-jan2026.md` → "Product Strategy & Process Definition"

**Immediate:**
1. Schedule 1-hour session with Leo to define PMF segments
2. Design the design sprint format
3. Identify participants and schedule
