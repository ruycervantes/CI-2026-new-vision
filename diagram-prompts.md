# Diagram Prompts for Conscious Insights v2

Prompts designed for Google Gemini image generation. All diagrams use a **whiteboard/sketch aesthetic** — hand-drawn look, collaborative feel, as if drawn during a strategy session.

## 1. The Integrated Change Cycle

**Purpose:** Shows how Thinking Partner and Accountability Partner work together as two modes of one system, not separate products.

**Gemini Prompt:**
```
Create a whiteboard-style diagram showing two interconnected boxes side by side, drawn with hand-sketched lines and a collaborative feel.

Left box labeled "THINKING PARTNER" with subtitle "(Lever 1: Consciousness)" containing bullet points:
- Exec coaching sessions
- Gain perspective
- Process setbacks
- Understand the gap

Right box labeled "ACCOUNTABILITY PARTNER" with subtitle "(Lever 2: Action)" containing bullet points:
- Concrete microhabits
- Daily practice
- Check-ins and follow-up
- Adjustments based on experience

Between the boxes, draw two curved arrows forming a cycle:
- Top arrow pointing right, labeled "CONCRETE ACTIONS"
- Bottom arrow pointing left, labeled "EXPERIENCES (successes, setbacks)"

Style: Hand-drawn whiteboard sketch with blue and black marker look. Slightly imperfect lines. White background with subtle paper texture. Professional but informal feeling.
```

**Key Elements Checklist:**
- [ ] Two distinct boxes for each Partner
- [ ] Lever 1 and Lever 2 labels visible
- [ ] Bidirectional arrows between them
- [ ] "Concrete Actions" and "Experiences" labeled on arrows
- [ ] Whiteboard/sketch aesthetic

## 2. Current vs. New Microhabit Cycle

**Purpose:** Shows the evolution from a one-time linear flow to an iterative cycle that users can repeat N times.

**Gemini Prompt:**
```
Create a whiteboard-style comparison diagram showing two flows side by side.

LEFT SIDE - Label: "CURRENT CYCLE (works 1 time)"
Draw a straight horizontal arrow with boxes along it:
Assessment → Debrief → Microhabit → Follow-up → Check-in → [END]
The flow ends with a stop sign or "X" symbol.

RIGHT SIDE - Label: "NEW CYCLE (works N times)"
Draw a flow that starts linear then becomes circular:
Assessment → Debrief → [CIRCULAR LOOP containing: Microhabit → Follow-up → Adjustment]
The circular loop has "×N" written next to it.
Below the loop, draw a downward arrow labeled "Change microhabit or focus area"

Style: Hand-drawn whiteboard sketch. Use different colors for current (red/orange) and new (green/blue). Arrows should look hand-drawn. Include small doodles like checkmarks or stars. White background.
```

**Key Elements Checklist:**
- [ ] Clear side-by-side comparison
- [ ] Linear flow on left ending definitively
- [ ] Circular/iterative loop on right
- [ ] "×N" notation showing repetition
- [ ] Exit point from the loop visible
- [ ] Color differentiation between old and new

## 3. Juan's Day Timeline

**Purpose:** Makes the "workflow integration" hypothesis tangible by showing touchpoints throughout a real workday.

**Gemini Prompt:**
```
Create a horizontal timeline diagram in whiteboard sketch style showing a leader's typical workday with system intervention points.

Timeline runs from 8:00 AM to 5:00 PM with markers at:

8:00 - Email icon - "Reviews email"
       System bubble: "Suggestions for difficult email"

9:00 - Calendar icon - "Checks calendar"
       System bubble: "Reminder: Meeting with Pedro. Remember your 3-second pause."

10:00 - Video call icon - "Meeting in MS Teams"
        System bubble: "(During intervention if possible)"

11:00 - Checkmark icon - "Finishes meeting"
        System bubble: "How did it go? Were you able to apply the pause?"

2:00 PM - Presentation icon - "Prepares presentation"
          System bubble: "Help preparing difficult conversation"

5:00 PM - Sunset/close icon - "Closes the day"
          System bubble: "Brief reflection on the day"

Style: Hand-drawn whiteboard aesthetic. Timeline as a horizontal line with clock face at start. Icons should be simple sketches. System intervention bubbles in a different color (blue or green). Casual, collaborative feeling. Include a small stick figure of "Juan" at the start.
```

**Key Elements Checklist:**
- [ ] Horizontal timeline clearly visible
- [ ] 6 key moments marked with times
- [ ] Simple icons for each activity
- [ ] System intervention bubbles at each point

## 4. Feature Dependency Map

**Purpose:** Shows how the 7 priorities depend on each other and what can be built in parallel.

**Gemini Prompt:**
```
Create a dependency diagram in whiteboard sketch style showing 7 numbered features and their relationships.

Nodes (draw as hand-sketched rounded rectangles):
P1: "Iterative Cycle" (green - foundation)
P2: "Conversational Follow-up"
P3: "MS Teams Integration"
P4: "TP ↔ AP Integration"
P5: "Structured Memory"
P6: "Adaptive Reminders"
P7: "Goals Dashboard"

Dependencies (draw as arrows with "blocks" or "needs" labels):
- P1 → P2 (P2 depends on P1)
- P1 → P4 (P4 depends on P1)
- P3 → P6 (P6 depends on P3)
- P5 → P7 (P7 depends on P5)
- P1 → P7 (P7 also depends on P1)

Show parallel tracks:
- "Shamil" label near P2
- "Mike" label near P3
- "Ruy" label near P1

Style: Whiteboard sketch with hand-drawn boxes and arrows. Use colors: green for "can start now", yellow for "has dependencies", gray for "future". Include small person icons or initials next to assigned items.
```

**Key Elements Checklist:**
- [ ] All 7 priorities visible as nodes
- [ ] Dependency arrows clearly showing what blocks what
- [ ] Team member assignments visible
- [ ] Parallel tracks identifiable
- [ ] Color coding for status
- [ ] Hand-drawn aesthetic

## 5. The Dynamic Gap Visualization

**Purpose:** Shows that the gap between "who I want to be" and "who I am" isn't static—it's a journey with setbacks and leaps.

**Gemini Prompt:**
```
Create a journey visualization in whiteboard sketch style showing personal growth over time.

Draw a graph-like visualization:
- X-axis: Time (left to right, with subtle month markers)
- Y-axis: Progress toward "Who I want to be" (bottom = "Who I am now", top = "Who I want to be")

The journey line should NOT be straight. Draw it as a wavy, organic path that:
- Starts at bottom left
- Goes up, then has a dip labeled "Setback"
- Recovers with a star labeled "Insight gained"
- Has another small dip
- Then a steep rise labeled "Consciousness leap"
- Continues upward toward the goal

Mark key moments along the path:
- "Initial assessment" at start
- "First microhabit" early on
- "Setback: old patterns" at a dip
- "Coaching session" at recovery point
- "New awareness" at a peak

At the top, draw a star or goal icon with "Who I want to be"
At the bottom left, draw a person icon with "Where I started"

Style: Hand-drawn whiteboard sketch. The path should look organic, not computerized. Use different colors for setbacks (red/orange) and breakthroughs (green/blue). Include small annotations and doodles. Emotional, human feeling.
```

**Key Elements Checklist:**
- [ ] Non-linear trajectory clearly visible
- [ ] Setbacks shown as dips
- [ ] Recovery/leap moments marked
- [ ] Key moments annotated
- [ ] Start and end points labeled
- [ ] Emotional, human quality to the drawing

## 6. Integration Architecture Stack

**Purpose:** Shows the technical layers from user experience down to data sources.

**Gemini Prompt:**
```
Create a layered architecture diagram in whiteboard sketch style, drawn as stacked horizontal boxes.

From top to bottom, draw 5 layers as hand-sketched rectangles:

Layer 1 (top): "INTEGRATED UX LAYER"
Subtitle: "One system from user's perspective"

Layer 2: "THINKING PARTNER + ACCOUNTABILITY PARTNER"
Subtitle: "Two modes of the same system"

Layer 3: "STRUCTURED MEMORY"
Subtitle: "The user's change trajectory"
Small bullets inside: "Starting point, Trajectory, Key moments, Current state"

Layer 4: "CONTEXT MANAGER"
Subtitle: "Pulls information from user's world"

Layer 5 (bottom): Three separate boxes side by side:
- "MS Teams" with chat icon
- "Calendar" with calendar icon
- "Email" with envelope icon

Draw arrows flowing down between layers, and arrows coming up from the bottom three boxes into Context Manager.

Style: Whiteboard sketch with hand-drawn boxes. Use blue for the stack, different color (green) for the bottom integrations. Arrows should look hand-drawn. Include small icons next to labels. Clean but informal.
```

**Key Elements Checklist:**
- [ ] 5 distinct layers stacked vertically
- [ ] Clear labels for each layer
- [ ] Three integration sources at bottom (Teams, Calendar, Email)
- [ ] Arrows showing data flow
- [ ] "Structured Memory" has detail visible
- [ ] Hand-drawn aesthetic

## 7. Competitive Positioning Matrix

**Purpose:** Shows what's easy vs. hard to replicate, making the case for why "owning the behavior change cycle" is defensible.

**Gemini Prompt:**
```
Create a 2-column comparison diagram in whiteboard sketch style.

LEFT COLUMN - Header: "EASY TO REPLICATE ❌"
Draw this column with a red/orange tint or border.
List items (with X marks):
- "AI chatbot wrapper"
- "Coaching conversations"
- "Simple reminders"
- "Single debrief session"
- "Generic prompts"

Small annotation: "Anyone with Claude/GPT can build this"

RIGHT COLUMN - Header: "HARD TO REPLICATE ✓"
Draw this column with a green tint or border, slightly larger or emphasized.
List items (with checkmarks):
- "Complete change methodology"
- "Orchestrated behavior cycle"
- "Deep workflow integrations"
- "Accumulated knowledge of what works"
- "Structured user trajectory memory"

Small annotation: "This is what we're building"

At the bottom, draw a simple arrow pointing from left to right with text: "Commodity → Defensible Moat"

Style: Whiteboard sketch. Hand-drawn boxes and text. Use color to contrast the two sides (red-ish left, green-ish right). Include small doodles like warning signs on left, shields or fortresses on right. Make the right side visually "win".
```

**Key Elements Checklist:**
- [ ] Two clear columns with contrasting headers
- [ ] 5 items in each column
- [ ] Visual emphasis on "hard to replicate" side
- [ ] Annotations explaining the difference
- [ ] "Commodity → Moat" progression shown
- [ ] Color coding (red = bad, green = good)
