# Conscious Insights 2026 Vision - Command Center

## What This Is

Strategic planning hub for Conscious Insights v2 evolution. Contains the vision, roadmap planning, and action items for Q1 2026.

**Timeline:** 3 months to prove product-market fit.

## Strategic Positioning

> "Si nos quedamos como 'tenemos un chatbot de coaching', competimos con todos. Si nos posicionamos como 'somos dueños del ciclo de cambio de comportamiento', es otra conversación."

**The moat:** Not a chatbot. We own the complete behavior change cycle - methodology, orchestration, integrations, accumulated knowledge, and user trajectory.
