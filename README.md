# Stoic Platform — Command Center

## What This Is

Strategic planning hub for the Stoic platform (formerly Conscious Insights). Contains platform vision, product specs, roadmap, and action items.

**Timeline:** 3 months to prove product-market fit.

---

## Strategic Positioning

**We help humans have better conversations** — with themselves, with others, as teams, as organizations — through AI that increases consciousness.

**Two design spaces, one shared foundation:**
- **Leadership Development (LD):** Individual behavior change — closing the gap between who you say you want to be and who you show up as
- **Team Effectiveness (HPT):** Team conversations — agreements, commitments, facilitation, evolving together
- **Shared:** AI Coach with multi-session memory, enterprise integration, visibility as design constraint
