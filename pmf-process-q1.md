# PMF Process - Q1 2026

> For discussion: Ruy + Leo

---

## Goal

Validate Stoic direction by end of Q1. Decide: Behavior Change vs High Performance Team.

---

## Exit Criteria

**We have PMF signal if:**

1. **3 new paying customers** (beyond current pipeline)
2. **Plus any of these qualitative signals:**
   - Unprompted referrals
   - Expansion requests ("can we add more?")
   - Dependency language ("can't go back")

---

## Ownership

| Who | Owns | How |
|-----|------|-----|
| **Leo** | Commercial validation | Customer meetings, proposals, deals |
| **Ruy** | User validation | Pilots, prototypes, product tests |

---

## Weekly Review

- **When:** Thu/Fri, 30 min
- **Who:** Ruy, Leo

**Each week we ask:**
1. What customer conversations happened?
2. What did we learn?
3. What user experiments ran?
4. Does evidence point toward BC or HPT?

---

## Validation Methods

### Commercial (Leo)
- Track conversations that shift from "nice chatbot" to "this is different"
- Pipeline opportunities from feature demos
- Objections heard (and patterns)

### User (Ruy)
- Friendly pilots (Leo's contacts, internal, friends)
- Prototype testing before building
- Live testing on testing.stoicq.com

## Timeline

| When | Milestone |
|------|-----------|
| **Jan** | Process running, first experiments |
| **Feb** | Evidence accumulating, patterns emerging |
| **End Q1** | Decision: BC vs HPT direction |

## Open Questions

- [ ] How many user pilots can we run in Q1?
- [ ] What's the minimum evidence to decide direction?
