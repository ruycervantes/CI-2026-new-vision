# Conscious Insights - Vision for Behavior Change

---

## 1. Why This Vision

We face two problems that demand a new direction.

### Problem 1: The Product is Vulnerable

The current product works. It has value. Clients understand it.

But the market sees us as "a chatbot." We learned this with Sigma — an advanced client who saw us as just another tool, not as owners of a change process.

The market is changing fast. In 12-18 months there will be many generic AI coaches. Anyone with access to Claude or GPT can build a coaching chatbot with good prompting. If we stay where we are, we'll be just another one in the crowd.

**We need to own the entire behavior change cycle, not just offer conversations.**

### Problem 2: People Struggle to Change

Self-development is hard. People don't naturally persist.

> "Sigo teniendo esta impresión de que si el producto está diseñado para ayudarle a personas a que hagan un proceso de crecimiento de propia voluntad... nos pone en una situación muy vulnerable, en tanto en cuanto no es lo normal que las personas hagamos eso y que seamos consistentes."

Current tools track habits but don't help people ACTUALLY change. They nag when you fail instead of helping you adapt. They count streaks instead of connecting daily actions to what you really want.

**We're integrating the best research on how change happens — from HCI, behavioral science, and longitudinal goal-setting studies — to build a system that actually helps people change.**

### Our Response

1. Build a system grounded in research on what makes people persist
2. Own the complete cycle: goals → gaps → habits → adjustment → evolution
3. Not just a coach that talks — a system that guides real change

---

## 2. The Bet

We are going to own the behavior change cycle.

> "Si nos quedamos como 'tenemos un chatbot de coaching', competimos con todos. Si nos posicionamos como 'somos dueños del ciclo de cambio de comportamiento', es otra conversación."

### What is NOT Easy to Replicate

- **The complete behavior change methodology** — grounded in research, not intuition
- **The system that orchestrates the entire cycle** — not just a conversation, but goals, habits, adjustments, evolution
- **The integrations that create real stickiness** — we reach users where they already are
- **The accumulated knowledge about what works** — what interventions move people, when, how
- **The structured memory of the user's change trajectory** — not just chat history, but a model of their growth

**That's what we're going to build.**

---

## 3. One System, Two Modes

The system has two modes — not two separate products, but two aspects of the same experience:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                         STOIC                                   │

│                             │                                   │
└─────────────────────────────┴───────────────────────────────────┘
```

### When Each Mode Activates

| Moment | Mode | What Happens |
|--------|------|--------------|
| Starting out | Coach | Set goals, understand yourself, create the plan |
| Day to day | Daily Companion | Practice habits, track progress, check in |
| Hit a setback | Coach | Process what happened, adjust approach |
| Weekly reflection | Daily Companion | Quick check-in on progress |
| Monthly/quarterly | Coach | Review trajectory, evolve goals |
| Pattern detected | Coach | "You've struggled for 2 weeks. Let's talk." |

### Mode Transitions

For V1: Transitions are **explicit**. The user chooses to enter Coach mode or the system suggests it.

Future: Research whether users need more fluid transitions where the system senses when a deeper conversation is needed.

---

## 4. The Goal Hierarchy

Research on longitudinal goal-setting shows that persistence requires connecting daily actions to what people really want. We use a three-level hierarchy:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                                                                 │
│   DESTINATION GOAL (Extrinsic Hook)                             │
│   "Get promoted to team lead"                                   │
│   "Be someone people want on their team"                        │
│                                                                 │
│   → Hooks initial engagement                                    │
│   → The thing you actually care about achieving                 │
│                                                                 │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                             ↓                                   │
│   MANAGEMENT GOAL (Intrinsic/Mindset)                           │
│   "Be a Learner, not a Knower"                                  │
│   "Be a Partner, not a Victim"                                  │
│                                                                 │
│   → Drives persistence (intrinsic motivation)                   │
│   → The kind of person you need to become                       │
│   → Connected to your values, not just outcomes                 │
│                                                                 │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                             ↓                                   │
│   TRACKING GOAL (Microhabit)                                    │
│   "Ask one Learner question per meeting"                        │
│   "Pause 3 seconds before responding"                           │
│                                                                 │
│   → Measurable daily action                                     │
│   → Structured as If-Then: "If X happens, then I do Y"          │
│   → What gets tracked and practiced                             │
│                                                                 │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Why This Matters

- **Destination Goals** get people started — they care about promotions, being liked, avoiding problems
- **Management Goals** keep people going — intrinsic motivation is the strongest predictor of long-term engagement
- **Tracking Goals** make it concrete — you can't practice "be a better leader," but you can practice "ask a Learner question"

**All three must be connected and visible.** The user must see how their daily habit connects to their destination.

---

## 5. The Change Process

Four stages, facilitated by Coach and Daily Companion:

### Stage 1: Know Yourself

**Mode:** Coach (Assessment + Debrief)

The user completes the Conscious Business assessment and has a debrief conversation. This helps them understand their patterns — where they're a Knower, Victim, or Pleaser.

**This works today.** The assessment and debrief flow is solid.

### Stage 2: Set Intrinsic Goals

**Mode:** Coach (Powerful Conversation)

This is where the redesign matters. The goal-setting conversation must:

1. **Connect to what they actually want** — not just "the assessment says work on X"
   - What do you want in your career?
   - What would change if you got that?
   - What relationships matter to you?

2. **Use Mental Contrasting** — visualize the desired future AND the obstacle
   - "Imagine you're the team lead. What's that like?"
   - "Now, what's getting in the way? How does your Knower show up?"

3. **Result in OWNED goals** — not assigned
   - Destination Goal: "I want to be seen as someone people want on their team"
   - Management Goal: "I need to be a Learner, not prove I'm right all the time"

**Key insight:** Goals must be OWNED (from intrinsic conversation), not ASSIGNED (from assessment alone).

### Stage 3: Connect to Action

**Mode:** Coach → Handoff to Daily Companion

The Coach helps create the specific habit using Implementation Intentions:

**If-Then Structure:**
> "IF I'm in a meeting and I want to prove I'm right, THEN I will ask one Learner question instead."

This connects:
- The trigger (wanting to prove I'm right) — from the Gap
- The action (ask a Learner question) — the Tracking Goal
- The purpose (being seen as collaborative) — the Destination Goal

The Coach then hands off to Daily Companion for execution.

### Stage 4: Daily Practice

**Mode:** Daily Companion

The Daily Companion:
- Sends reminders where the user already is (MS Teams, calendar)
- Does brief check-ins: "How did the meeting go? Were you able to ask a Learner question?"
- Updates the GPS: shows progress toward Destination Goal
- Surfaces experiences back to Coach when patterns emerge

---

## 6. The Adjust Stage

This is critical. When users fail, most systems just track the failure. That doesn't help.

### What NOT to Do vs. What TO Do

| Don't | Do |
|-------|-----|
| Track failure ("You missed 3 days") | Reinterpret ("What got in the way?") |
| Nag ("Remember your habit!") | Anticipate barriers ("Tough week ahead. Let's plan.") |
| Create guilt ("You're falling behind") | Help learn a new skill or approach |
| Just reset the streak | Understand and adapt |

### When Adjust Triggers Coach Mode

The Daily Companion monitors patterns. When it detects:
- Multiple missed days
- Check-ins with negative sentiment
- Stalled progress

It suggests: "You've been struggling with this for a couple weeks. Want to talk about what's happening?"

This triggers Coach mode — not to guilt, but to:
1. **Reinterpret** — "What's been getting in the way?"
2. **Anticipate** — "Looking at next week, where might this be hard?"
3. **Adapt** — "Should we try a different approach? A different trigger?"

**The goal is learning, not compliance.**

---

## 7. Juan's Journey

Juan is a leader at a client company. He wants to be a better leader — specifically, he wants to be seen as someone people want on their team, and he wants a promotion to team lead.

### Stage 1: Juan Meets the Coach

**Assessment + Debrief**

Juan completes the Conscious Business assessment. The debrief reveals he scores high on "Knower" — he tends to prove he's right rather than stay curious.

**The Goal Conversation**

The Coach doesn't just say "work on being less of a Knower." Instead:

> **Coach:** "What do you actually want in your career right now?"
>
> **Juan:** "I want the team lead position. And honestly, I want people to actually want to work with me."
>
> **Coach:** "What would be different if you had that?"
>
> **Juan:** "I'd feel like I'm making a real impact. And I wouldn't feel like I have to fight for respect."
>
> **Coach:** "Let's look at what might be getting in the way. Your assessment shows a strong Knower pattern. How does that show up for you?"
>
> **Juan:** "I guess... I always feel like I have to have the answer. Like if I don't know, people will think I'm not capable."
>
> **Coach:** "So there's a belief: 'If I don't have the answer, I'm not capable.' And that drives you to prove you're right. How do you think others experience that?"
>
> **Juan:** "...Probably like I'm not listening. Like I don't value their input."

**Result:**
- Destination Goal: "Be seen as someone people want on their team → team lead"
- Management Goal: "Be a Learner — value others' input, stay curious"
- The Gap: "My Knower pattern makes people feel unheard"

### Stage 2: Juan Connects to Action

The Coach helps Juan create a specific habit:

> **Coach:** "Let's make this concrete. When does your Knower show up most?"
>
> **Juan:** "Meetings. When someone says something I disagree with, I immediately want to show why they're wrong."
>
> **Coach:** "Okay. Let's create an If-Then: 'If I'm in a meeting and I want to prove I'm right, then I will ___.' What could you do instead?"
>
> **Juan:** "Ask a question? Like, actually try to understand their point?"
>
> **Coach:** "Perfect. 'If I want to prove I'm right, then I ask one Learner question.' We'll track this. Every time you do it, you're one step closer to being the leader people want to work with."

**The habit:**
> IF I'm in a meeting and I want to prove I'm right, THEN I ask one Learner question.

Coach hands off to Daily Companion.

### Stage 3: Juan Practices Daily

**Morning (MS Teams):**
> "Good morning, Juan. You have 3 meetings today. Remember your practice: when you want to prove you're right, ask a Learner question instead."

**After a meeting:**
> "How did the 10am meeting go? Were you able to ask a Learner question?"

**Juan responds:**
> "Yeah, actually. Pedro said something I totally disagreed with, and instead of arguing, I asked him to explain his thinking. Turned out he had a point I hadn't considered."

**Daily Companion:**
> "That's a win. That's exactly the kind of moment that changes how people experience you. Logged it."

**GPS updates:** Juan sees his progress bar move.

### Stage 4: Juan Hits a Setback

Two weeks later, Juan has a rough week. He misses check-ins. When he does respond, it's negative: "Didn't do it. Too stressed."

**Daily Companion detects the pattern and suggests:**
> "You've had a tough couple of weeks. Want to talk about what's going on?"

Juan says yes. Coach mode activates.

> **Coach:** "What's been happening?"
>
> **Juan:** "Work has been insane. And honestly, when I'm stressed, I don't have the bandwidth to think about this stuff. I just react."
>
> **Coach:** "That makes sense. Stress makes the Knower stronger. It's a protection mechanism. What if we adjusted the approach for high-stress times?"
>
> **Juan:** "Like what?"
>
> **Coach:** "Instead of 'ask a Learner question,' what if during stressful weeks, the practice is just 'notice when you're in Knower mode.' No action required, just awareness. Would that be sustainable?"
>
> **Juan:** "Yeah, I could do that."

**New habit for stressful periods:**
> IF I'm in Knower mode, THEN I just notice it.

The system adapts. No guilt. Learning.

### Stage 5: Juan Achieves Sustained Change

After several months:
- Juan has iterated through multiple habits
- He's moved from "notice the Knower" to "ask Learner questions" to "facilitate others' ideas in meetings"
- His GPS shows clear progress toward "team lead"
- His team notices the difference
- He gets the promotion

**The trajectory is visible.** Juan can look back and see: where he started, what he worked on, the setbacks he overcame, where he is now.

---

## 8. The Goals Dashboard (GPS)

The user must see that each daily action moves them toward their destination. This is the "GPS" that keeps them walking.

### Key Principles

1. **Connection is visible** — Every habit completion updates progress toward Destination Goal
2. **Trajectory, not just state** — Shows where you started, key moments, where you are
3. **Wins are captured** — Not just counts, but specific moments that mattered
4. **Next focus is clear** — What you're working on now vs. what's coming

## 9. What We Build Q1 2026

We have 3 months to prove this works. We'll deliver 3 of these 4 features:

| # | Feature | Owner | Status | Why It Matters |
|---|---------|-------|--------|----------------|
| 1 | MS Teams Notifications | Mike | In progress | Reach users where they are |
| 2 | Coach Multi-Session | Shamil | Needs sprint story | Enable the goal-setting conversation |
| 3 | Voice Integration (TTS) | TBD | Needs validation | Make check-ins more natural |
| 4 | Bidirectional Teams Chatbot | Mike | Needs validation | Full conversation in Teams |

**Decision needed:** Feature 3 vs 4 priority → customer validation with Leo.

### Dependencies

```
Coach Multi-Session (Shamil)
         ↓

## 11. Open Questions & Risks

### Questions to Resolve

| Question | How to Resolve |
|----------|----------------|
| How do we handle self-report bias? | Consider peer feedback, manager input, or objective signals |
| Which context integrations move the needle? | Start with user-reported context, measure before building integrations |
| What metrics show the iterative cycle works? | % completing multiple cycles, interaction frequency, NPS |
| Should we add peer accountability? | V2 consideration — research social goal-setting |

### Risks

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Users don't engage with goal-setting conversation | Make it shorter, test with real users, iterate |
| Coach mode feels like "more work" | Position as help, not homework; make it valuable |
| MS Teams integration is blocked by IT | Have fallback channels (email, web) |
| We build features that don't move PMF | Validate with Leo + customers before building |

## 12. Hypotheses to Validate

These are bets, not facts:

1. **Intrinsic goal hypothesis:** If goals come from a powerful conversation (not just assessment), users will be more committed.

2. **If-Then hypothesis:** If habits are structured as Implementation Intentions, adherence will be higher.

3. **GPS hypothesis:** If users see daily actions connected to their Destination Goal, they'll persist longer.

4. **Adjust hypothesis:** If we help users learn from failure instead of just tracking it, they'll stay engaged.

5. **Integration hypothesis:** If we reach users where they already are (MS Teams), interaction frequency will increase.

6. **Coach-triggered hypothesis:** If the system suggests Coach mode when patterns emerge, users will have more breakthroughs.

# Appendix

## A. Research Foundations

### Goal Hierarchy Framework

From longitudinal goal-setting research:

- **Management Goals** = The desired professional/personal state (who you want to be)
- **Tracking Goals** = The specific behaviors that move you there (what you do daily)
- Persistence requires connecting tracking to management to destination

### IIMC: Implementation Intentions + Mental Contrasting

Two evidence-based techniques for behavior change:

**Mental Contrasting:**
1. Visualize the desired future (Destination Goal achieved)
2. Contrast with current obstacles (the Gap)
3. Creates motivation by connecting desire to reality

**Implementation Intentions:**
1. Structure habits as "If X, then Y"
2. The "If" is the trigger (situation, cue, obstacle)
3. The "Then" is the specific action
4. Reduces cognitive load — you've pre-decided what to do

### The Adjust Stage

Research shows persistence fails not at habit formation but at barrier navigation. Effective systems:
- Help users **reinterpret** goals when they fail (not just track failure)
- Help users **anticipate** future barriers
- Help users **learn new skills** when current approach isn't working

### Self-Report Limitations

Relying solely on user self-report has bias. Possible mitigations:
- Peer or manager feedback loops
- Objective behavioral signals (if available)
- Prompting for specific evidence, not just feelings

## B. Glossary

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Destination Goal** | The extrinsic outcome the user wants (promotion, being liked, avoiding problems) |
| **Management Goal** | The intrinsic mindset shift needed (be a Learner, be a Partner) |
| **Tracking Goal** | The specific microhabit practiced daily |
| **The Gap** | The distance between who the user is and who they want to be |
| **Coach** | System mode for deep conversations: goal-setting, processing setbacks, evolving the plan |
| **Daily Companion** | System mode for daily practice: reminders, check-ins, progress tracking |
| **If-Then Habit** | Implementation Intention format: "If [trigger], then [action]" |
| **Mental Contrasting** | Technique: visualize desired future, contrast with current obstacle |
| **GPS Dashboard** | Visual showing progress toward Destination Goal |
| **Adjust Stage** | When user struggles, system helps reinterpret and adapt (not just track failure) |

## C. Previous Hypotheses (from original vision)

Preserved for reference:

1. **Iterative cycle hypothesis:** Multiple microhabit cycles before changing focus area increases adherence.
2. **Conversational follow-up hypothesis:** LLM conversation beats forms for check-ins.
3. **Adaptive reminders hypothesis:** Reminders that adapt to timing/channel increase adherence.
4. **Connected goals hypothesis:** Connecting to real motivations increases commitment.
5. **Workflow integration hypothesis:** Reaching users where they are increases frequency.
6. **Context hypothesis:** Real user context makes interventions more relevant.
