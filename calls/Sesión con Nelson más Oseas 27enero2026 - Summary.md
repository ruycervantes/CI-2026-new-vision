# Strategy Session Summary: Team Effectiveness & Pricing Alignment
**Date:** January 27, 2026
**Participants:** Oseas (CEO), Nelson (Axialent Digital), Leo (Sales), Ruy (PM/CTO)
**Absent:** Dolo (returns in 2 weeks)

---

## Executive Summary

Two-part session: (1) Group discussion on pricing strategy, Grupo Vitro opportunity, and blended-by-design positioning; (2) Deep 1:1 between Ruy and Nelson on digital layer vision, AI coaching architecture, and team effectiveness MVP design. Key decision: current proposals use existing capabilities while Q2+ designs evolve to true blended experience.

---

## 1. Pricing Strategy for Partners

**Status:** Unresolved but deprioritized

**What was discussed:**
- Partners need simple pricing they can incorporate quickly ("ventana de tiempo corta")
- Current Excel-based pricing is too artisanal and complex
- Value-based pricing vs per-seat pricing tension
- Grupo Vitro example: Tirri quoted ~$300/person for 50-80 leaders

**Key Principle from Oseas:**
> "Si va a ser blended, blended, pues entonces no me separes los ingredientes. Si me itemizes lo digital, me estás diciendo esto es un add-on."

**Decision:**
- Partners receive combined pricing (not itemized digital line items)
- Partners should present digital as integrated, not separate
- Pricing systematization deferred; use current calculator for now

---

## 2. Grupo Vitro Opportunity

**Status:** In progress, urgent

**What was discussed:**
- Tirri requested proposal; opportunity is scale (50-80 leaders now → many more if successful)
- Initial project: ~$300/person = ~$15-24K total
- Real value: proving model for larger deployment

**Action items:**
- Oseas: Review deck with Oseas's comments, meet Tirry tomorrow
- Ruy + Nelson: Answer reporting capability questions (what can we measure/show)
- All: Ensure digital is presented as integrated, not add-on

---

## 3. Meta Digital (740K Target)

**Status:** Shared goal established

**What was discussed:**
- Group Axialent has shared digital revenue target: $740K
- Attribution between Stoic vs Axialent digitalización should NOT distract
- Extreme cases: if 100% comes from one side, that's a different strategic conversation
- For now: work together to hit the number

**Decision:** Don't split hairs on attribution. Shared goal, shared effort.

---

## 4. Blended By Design Vision

**Status:** Direction clear, execution evolving

**What was discussed:**
- All Axialent offerings should be designed from scratch with digital lens
- HPT redesign happening with Dolo + Nelson
- Stoic should be "best option on the rebote" for digital layer

**Oseas's framing:**
> "Lo que no sería conducente para el cliente, para nosotros, sería restarles mucho valor que pudieran tener con la solución nada más para encajarnos ahí."

---

## 5. Ruy's Team Effectiveness MVP Design (Presented)

**Status:** Conceptual, well-received

**What was presented:**
- 90-day journey starting with assessments (team + CB individual)
- Gap identification → Plan creation
- Track 1: Team process (offsite, check-ins, team agreements document)
- Track 2: Individual coaching (AI coach over 6 sessions + microhabits)
- Key artifact: **Team Agreements Document** - living document that contextualizes everything

**Key insight from Ruy:**
> "Si tú tienes ese artefacto en digital, luego le podemos meter el contexto pegado a mano en las primeras iteraciones para que parta de ahí el coach."

---

## 6. Nelson's Digital Layer Vision (Impact Platform)

**Status:** Roadmap shared, aligned with Ruy's direction

**Three pillars:**
1. **Data Layer** - Connect information sources (Surveys, Brilliant assessments, Thinkific progress, eventually AI coach data)
2. **Analytics Portal** - Client-facing impact dashboards
3. **Coach Intelligence Portal** - Coach preparation + transcripts + journey visibility

**Blended Journeys focus:** HPT + Leadership Development (similar approaches, different labels)

**Goal:** Enable 20% price premium by demonstrating clear impact

---

## 7. AI Coach Architecture Discussion

**Status:** Core requirement identified, not yet built

**What was discussed:**
- Need AI coach that maintains context across 6+ sessions
- Different from "chatbot as capstone" - this is true coaching with memory
- Two implementation approaches: artifacts per session vs memory graph
- CB Assessment debrief could be first session with AI coach

**Key technical insight:**
> "Claude agents SDK que algo te debería... le dices que puede utilizar archivos y le das skills para que lo use y esto lo pones en tu agente y ahí lleva su memoria."

---

## 8. Impact Measurement Strategy

**Status:** Conceptual approach agreed

**What was discussed:**
- Impact via qualitative changes documented in Team Agreements
- Participants articulate their own impact ("este es el impacto que me está generando")
- FROM state captured clearly at start; TO state emerges through process
- 4-quadrant model (purpose, roles, relationships, process) as framework

**Key insight from Nelson:**
> "Creo que lo que nos pasa muy seguido es olvidarnos que todo esto tiene que estar siempre girado acerca del impacto."

---

## 9. Torch Comparison (Reference)

**Status:** Benchmark identified

**What was discussed:**
- Torch does TA model: AI coach supports human coach
- Provides strategy layer + context layer
- AI sessions feed back to human coach
- Relevant architecture for Stoic vision

**Action:** Nelson to share Torch comparison link

---

## 10. Coordination with Dolo

**Status:** Meeting scheduled post-return

**What was discussed:**
- Dolo returns in 2 weeks
- Need alignment on HPT redesign direction
- Approach: arrive with proposal, expect pushback/refinement
- Second week of February target for aligned roadmap

## Key Decisions Made

| Decision | Details |
|----------|---------|
| Pricing presentation | Partners present digital as integrated, not line item |
| Commercial version | Use current capabilities for Vitro; evolve Q2+ |
| Meta attribution | Shared $740K goal; don't split hairs |
| Design conversation | With Dolo in 2 weeks; arrive with proposal |
| AI Coach priority | Core dependency for both behavior change and team effectiveness |

---

## Blockers Identified

| Blocker | Owner | Resolution |
|---------|-------|------------|
| No simple pricing model for partners | Nelson + Ruy | Deferred; use current calculator |
| AI Coach (6-session memory) doesn't exist yet | Ruy | Q1 build priority |
| Brilliant API limitations | Nelson | Writing to Brilliant about improvements |
| Dolo availability | - | Returns in 2 weeks |
