# Product Strategy — Stoic Office Hours Summary
**Date:** 28 January 2026
**Participants:** Oseas (CEO), Ruy (PM+CTO), Nelson (product/operations), Mike (dev lead)
**Type:** Product strategy alignment

---

## Executive Summary
The group aligned on the AI Coach as the shared technology foundation serving both Leadership Development and HPT (Team Effectiveness). Oseas pushed hard on a critical gap: the product needs **visibility/reporting** at the same level of maturity as the coaching — without visible impact data, the product is unsellable regardless of coaching quality. Nelson committed to owning the impact/visibility design. Oseas also mandated involving Thierry for commercial lens review.

## 1. AI Coach as Shared Foundation
**What was discussed:**
- Ruy presented the outcome of the Nelson 1-on-1: build one AI coach technology that serves both Leadership Development and HPT
- The core technology (multi-session memory, context tracking, goal management) is shared; the prompting, UX, and placement differ per product
- Mike confirmed: "No veo ningún mega challenge" — technically feasible with current capabilities
- Oseas's reaction: "me suena muy bien, me suena muy prudente" — approved the direction

**Decisions made:**
- AI Coach is the shared technology investment
- Not an either/or between Leadership Development and HPT — the coach serves both
- Oseas explicitly approved this direction

---

## 2. Oseas's "Car Metaphor" — Visibility is the Gap
**What was discussed:**
- Oseas used a car metaphor: the team is building a great chassis (coaching engine) but the car has no body (visibility/reporting)
- "No puedo salir a vender un chasis" — buyers don't understand or care about coaching methodology quality; they need to SEE impact
- Current coaching quality is "sufficient" for selling today — don't need to improve the engine further right now
- What's missing: dashboard/reporting that shows clients whether the coaching is working
- Key principle: **coaching quality and reporting quality must advance in lockstep** — "Si tengo 10 de coaching y 2 de reporte, no lo vendo"

**Decisions made:**
- Visibility/reporting is the priority gap to close, not coaching improvement
- Use what exists today for coaching; focus development energy on making impact visible

---

## 3. Thierry + Board Commercial Oversight
**What was discussed:**
- Oseas mandated involving Thierry in product vision review — he has commercial vision that Horacio/Richie lack
- Board determination: all digitalization work must be supervised by people with commercial lens (Thierry, Fernando Fascioli)
- Pricing uncertainty: does digital add-on increase ticket (100→115) or decrease it (100→50 because "it's digital now")? This is a critical strategic question the board is tracking
- Thierry's Vitro project cited as example: anchored to a CFO-validated $100M EBITDA impact → makes the business case concrete

**Decisions made:**
- Ruy and Nelson must include Thierry in the product vision review loop
- Commercial validation must happen alongside technical/methodology validation

---

## 4. Nelson Takes Ownership of Impact/Visibility
**What was discussed:**
- Nelson committed to owning the impact/visibility design
- He'll build on what he already started with the Vitro proposal
- Ruy will pass him Horacio and Richie research materials
- Nelson wants to validate first with existing capabilities (without the new AI Coach) — what value can we add now?
- Then layer in the AI Coach capabilities as they become available

**Decisions made:**
- Nelson owns impact/visibility design
- First pass: what can we show with current product
- Ruy sends Nelson the Horacio/Richie materials

---

## 5. Dual Value Proposition Confirmed
**What was discussed:**
- The value proposition is two things: (1) increase impact, (2) make it visible
- Impact increase: individual AI coaching for everyone on the team (previously only team leader got human coaching)
- Visibility: extract patterns, progress, adherence data from coaching sessions and surface it for sponsors/buyers
- Oseas: "Si no estoy incrementando el impacto, ¿para qué te lo compro? Y si no es visible, no me entero"

**Decisions made:**
- Both must be present to sell; one without the other is insufficient

---

## 6. HPT vs Leadership Development — "La Misma Chingadera"
**What was discussed:**
- Oseas cut through the HPT vs LD distinction: "todos son la misma chingadera"
- The blueprint is the same: Axialent teaches something → AI Coach reinforces it → show if it worked
- Don't over-invest in designing the "perfect HPT" now — the coddesign with Dolo and first client is Q2+
- Focus on the common foundation that serves any flavor

**Decisions made:**
- Stop distinguishing HPT vs LD at the technology level — build the common platform
- Specific HPT design waits for Dolo engagement (Q2+)

---

## 7. Demo/Prototype Timing
**What was discussed:**
- Oseas wants something showable for commercial feedback and Dolo conversation
- Ruy clarified: better to do visual storytelling (diagrams, comics in the vision doc) now, coded prototype later
- A coded prototype makes sense only after methodology validation with Horacio/Richie/Thierry
- Nelson will iterate on the vision doc with Ruy's materials first

**Decisions made:**
- Vision doc with visuals first (today/tomorrow)
- Coded prototype waits until after methodology and commercial validation

---

## Key Decisions Made

| Decision | Details |
|----------|---------|
| AI Coach is shared foundation | One technology, serves both LD and HPT |
| Visibility/reporting is the priority gap | Coaching quality is sufficient; reporting must catch up |
| Include Thierry in vision review | Commercial lens required by board |
| Nelson owns impact/visibility design | Builds on Vitro proposal work |
| HPT vs LD = same technology blueprint | Don't over-differentiate at platform level |
| Vision doc before coded prototype | Diagrams/visuals first, code later |
| Don't sell what doesn't exist yet | Current capabilities only in proposals |

---

## Blockers Identified

| Blocker | Owner | Resolution |
|---------|-------|------------|
| No impact visibility/reporting | Nelson | Design what to show clients; start with current data |
| Commercial validation needed | Ruy/Nelson | Schedule review with Thierry |
| Pricing strategy unclear (add-on vs replacement) | Oseas/Board | Board-level decision, Thierry + Fascioli input |
| HPT coddesign needs Dolo | Nelson | Q2+ timeline |

---

## Next Steps

1. Ruy sends Nelson: Horacio notes, Richie notes, design principles, digitization table
2. Nelson designs impact/visibility spec (what to show clients with current product)
3. Nelson + Ruy schedule review with Thierry
4. Ruy continues vision doc with visuals for communication
5. Ruy focuses on AI Coach multi-session architecture
6. Mike stays available for technical feasibility checks
