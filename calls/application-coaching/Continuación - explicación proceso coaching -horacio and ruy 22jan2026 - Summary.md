## Executive Summary

Horacio provides a detailed walkthrough of an actual HPT engagement (Western Union Argentina), showing the concrete sequence of activities. Key insight: there are TWO types of diagnostic — **behavioral** (Human Synergistics LSI/OCI) and **team functioning** (4-Quadrant model). The 4-Quadrant assessment identifies WHERE the team needs work; the behavioral assessments identify HOW individuals need to change.

The call also clarifies that HPT engagements can occur in two contexts:
1. **Standalone:** Client specifically asks for help with a team
2. **Part of culture transformation:** Team intervention is one component of a larger project

The design differs significantly based on which context applies.

## HPT Frameworks

### Three Models in Use

| Model | Origin | Usage |
|-------|--------|-------|
| **Katzenbach** | External (classic) | Original Axialent model, what Horacio learned |
| **Lencioni (5 Dysfunctions)** | External (newer) | Grew in Europe, different language/sequence |
| **Axialent 4-Quadrant** | Internal | Operationalization of Katzenbach — guides intervention design |

**Key insight:** The 4-Quadrant model IS the operationalization of Katzenbach. It translates the theory into actionable diagnostic and intervention design.

### The 4 Quadrants

| Quadrant | Focus | Example Issues |
|----------|-------|----------------|
| **Purpose/Values/Objectives** | Why the team exists, what it's trying to achieve | Unclear mission, misaligned goals |
| **Roles & Responsibilities** | Who does what | Role confusion, accountability gaps |
| **Processes** | How work gets done | Inefficient meetings, poor coordination |
| **Relationships** | Quality of conversations | Trust issues, undiscussables, poor CB skills |

The assessment produces a visual with concentric circles showing development level in each quadrant.

## HPT Context Matters

### Standalone Team Intervention

Client asks specifically for help with a team. Full sequence:
- Diagnostic (quanti + quali)
- Workshops/offsites
- Facilitated meetings
- Group coaching
- Individual coaching
- Individual diagnostics

### Part of Culture Transformation

Team intervention is one piece of a larger project. Key difference:
- Team members may have already done workshops in the larger project
- Team arrives "pre-warmed" — already aware of CB concepts
- Design can skip foundational teaching
- Focus shifts to application and specific team issues

## Western Union Case Study

### Project Origin

- **Buyer:** HR Director (trusted relationship with CEO)
- **Real problem:** CEO having issues with his direct reports
- **Proposal:** Individual coaching for CEO + team intervention

### Horacio's Observation

> "Yo me recuerdo que mis sensaciones iniciales eran que habíamos vendido un proyecto de equipo, pero que nacía más por disfuncionalidades del líder."

The project was sold as "team effectiveness" but the real need was leader development. The team intervention was somewhat secondary. This is NOT typical — usually both levels get comparable investment.

### Timeline

1. **Pre-project:** HR contact → CEO trust-building meeting → Approval
2. **Diagnostic Phase:**
   - Interviews (feedback on CEO and team)
   - LSI for all team members
   - OCI (team culture, possibly desired state)
   - 4-Quadrant assessment
3. **Launch:** Kickoff meeting with full team — explain process, introduce facilitator, set expectations
4. **Delivery:**
   - CEO: Individual LSI debrief + 6 coaching sessions
   - Team: Group LSI debrief (2 hours) + Offsites (2-day immersions) + Facilitated business meetings
5. **Ongoing:** Facilitator observes real business meetings, provides feedback, helps apply learning

### Two Types of Diagnostic

| Type | Instruments | What It Reveals |
|------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Behavioral** | LSI (individual), OCI (team culture) | What behaviors to change, gap between current and ideal |
| **Team Functioning** | 4-Quadrant assessment | Where the team needs work (purpose, roles, processes, relationships) |

**How they connect:** 4-Quadrant identifies the problem areas. Behavioral assessments (especially in the Relationships quadrant) show what CB skills need development.

### Opening the Gap

Two sources for creating the "burning platform":
1. **Behavioral gap:** LSI results vs. ideal profile (or vs. OCI desired)
2. **Team functioning gap:** 4-Quadrant results showing weak areas

> "Si en promedio ese equipo contestó que claridad de roles está en 1.5 en promedio, bueno, claramente eso lo voy a poner como agenda para abrir una conversación."

The diagnostic results DRIVE the agenda for offsites and interventions.

## Key Quotes

> "El modelo de cuatro cuadrantes es como la operacionalización del de Katzenbach."

> "Una cosa es que nos contrate un cliente para ayudar a que el equipo comercial mejore su efectividad como equipo... Ha habido algún acontecimiento reciente que conduce a que el cliente nos pida una ayuda."

> "Cuando trabajamos sobre el cuadrante de relaciones, es lo que más directamente justifica el teaching del modelo de conscious business."

> "Los materiales no se autoexplican — va a ser importante que las conversaciones que podamos tener tú y yo al respecto."
