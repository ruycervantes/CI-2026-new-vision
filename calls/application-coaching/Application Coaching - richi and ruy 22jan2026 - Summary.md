## Executive Summary

Richi explains Axialent's team effectiveness methodology and demonstrates coaching technique live with Ruy. Two major "aha moment" types emerge as design principles for behavior change:

1. **Espoused values vs values-in-action** — The gap between what people say they believe and how they actually behave
2. **"Ayúdame a ayudarte"** — Framing your needs in terms of the other's agenda, not your own

The live coaching session reveals: real emotional content is required for learning to "anchor" — hypothetical scenarios don't create change.

## 1. Team Effectiveness Framework

### Teams as Culture Cells
- Teams (especially leadership teams) are fundamental cells for culture
- Culture = "how people have to think and act to belong to the group"
- Leaders' behavior sends the strongest messages about culture

### Three Dimensions (I / Wi / It)

| Dimension | What it means | Key indicators |
|-----------|---------------|----------------|
| **I** (Individual) | Person is inspired by the project, feels it's what they need | Engagement, fit with career moment |
| **Wi** (We) | High trust, psychological safety, no undiscussables | People talk about everything openly |
| **It** (Purpose) | Team has its own purpose beyond company mission | Unique contribution, reason to exist |

### Three Intervention Tracks

| Track | Foreground | Background | Purpose |
|-------|------------|------------|---------|
| **Offsites** | Philosophy, principles, skills | Business context | Learn frameworks using real business conversations |
| **Meeting Facilitation** | Business | Philosophy | Catch behaviors in flow of work, help honor what they said they wanted |
| **Individual Coaching** | Person | Team context | Build individual skills that enable collective interdependence |

**Football metaphor:** You can't run a play (collective skill) without players who can kick and head (individual skills). Individual skills are "transcended and included" by collective skills.

## 2. The "Magic" — Moments of Truth

### The Gap = Raw Material

> "La brecha es la materia prima para trabajar"

The gap between:
- What people **say** they want (espoused values)
- What actually **happens** (values-in-action)

This gap is the raw material for coaching. Without it, people stay intellectual — they understand but don't change.

### How to Create Moments of Truth

1. **Observe the gap** in real-time (in meeting, in coaching session)
2. **Name it** — "I noticed X happened, but you said you wanted Y"
3. **Demonstrate alternative** via role modeling/role playing
4. **Anchor the learning** — It's memorable because it's happening NOW, not hypothetical

### Why It Works

> "Cuando está pasando en ese momento, no es que se lo estás leyendo de un libro o que están haciendo un ejemplo hipotético de un tercero."

The emotional engagement is what anchors learning. Richi's example: someone he coached 10-15 years ago still remembers a specific intervention because it touched them emotionally.

## 3. Live Coaching Demo

Richi offers to demonstrate by coaching Ruy on something real. Ruy shares:
- Frustration with direction changes (dashboard → behavior change → back to team effectiveness)
- Feeling burned out from Q4
- Sense that his efforts are "going to waste"
- Tension between what he wants to work on and what Oseas asks for

### Richi's Technique (Observable)

1. **Reflect back:** "Let me summarize in my words..."
2. **Check understanding:** "Am I getting this right?"
3. **Find what's underneath:** "What would make this not a problem for you?"
4. **Challenge gently:** "The time excuse is bullshit — you allocate time to what matters"
5. **Invite role play:** "Imagine you're Oseas and I'm you..."

## 4. "Ayúdame a Ayudarte" — Key Design Principle

### The Insight

When Ruy says "I need help" or "I'm frustrated," Richi reframes:

> "No me estás ayudando a ayudarte."

This is not about YOUR agenda. It's about serving the OTHER's agenda. The conversation shifts from "help me" to "I want to help you succeed, and I think we're suboptimizing."

### Why This Matters

- Opens the heart of the listener
- Removes defensiveness
- Makes it about contribution, not complaint
- Giver vs Taker: "Are you adding resources to the pool or taking from it?"

### For Product Design

This is a design principle: interventions should help users discover what they need FROM others and learn to ASK in a way that serves the other's agenda. This creates a virtuous circle where the team becomes more than the sum of its parts.

---

## 5. Philosophy & AI Discussion

### Giver vs Taker

> "Para mí lo más importante de todo es: are you a giver or are you a taker?"

- Capitalism transforms selfishness into service (you get rich by helping others)
- The question behind every intervention: Are you adding value to the system?

### AI and Consciousness

- The values embedded in AI come from the programmers and feedback loops
- Risk: humans are "chotos" (primitive) in self-knowledge — egoistic, greedy
- Opportunity: Axialent is at the intersection of intelligence and consciousness
- Constitutional AI is only as good as the consciousness level of whoever wrote it

### Subject-Object Theory

> "Cuando tú eres sujeto de algo, no lo ves. Para verlo tenés que moverte afuera y hacerlo objeto de tu análisis."

Moving people from subject to object is fundamental to conscious development.

## 6. Documentation & Next Steps

### Where to Find Materials

| Document | What it contains |
|----------|-----------------|
| Application Coaching Manual | Principles, self-centering, connection |
| Facilitator Guides (e.g., Meli) | Step-by-step intervention instructions |
| Proposals | How coaching, facilitation, offsites are explained |

**Go-to person:** Dolo (knows SharePoint, can find materials)

### Richi's Observation on Digitization

> "Si podemos hacer que un AI te dé coaching relativamente bueno, con eso podemos diseñar muchas cosas que ayuden a un equipo."

Individual coaching is more achievable technically than group interfaces. If you nail 1:1 coaching, it enables team-level interventions.

### Follow-up Actions

- Ruy to send Richi: AI podcast (OpenAI coach), book on history of intelligence
- Richi to review materials
- Reconvene to continue conversation
- Richi offered to be beta user

## Key Quotes

> "El gran ajá moment es cuando hay una discrepancia entre la teoría, entre los espoused values y los values in action."

> "No me estás ayudando a ayudarte."

> "La magia... está muy poco en los papers, en la documentación escrita."

> "Si le quitas la limitante de que tener coaching individual es estúpidamente caro y de repente está para todos, pues igual le puedes hacer mucho más."
