## 1. Design Principles

How should coaching/team development work?

### DP1: The Gap is the Raw Material

> "La brecha es la materia prima para trabajar"

Coaching works by finding the gap between:
- **Espoused values** — What people say they want
- **Values-in-action** — What actually happens

Without this gap, interventions stay intellectual. The gap creates the emotional energy needed for change.

**Implication for product:** The system must help users SEE their gap, not just tell them about it.

---

### DP2: Real Content Creates Real Learning

> "Tiene que ser con algo que sea verdad... la condición para que funcione es que haya energía de verdad en la sala."

Learning anchors when it's about something the person actually cares about. Hypothetical examples don't stick.

**Implication for product:** Don't use generic scenarios. Work with the user's actual situations, challenges, relationships.

---

### DP3: "Ayúdame a Ayudarte" — The Bridge from Individual to Team

> "No me estás ayudando a ayudarte"

When you need something, frame it in terms of how you can better serve the OTHER person's agenda. This:
- Opens the listener's heart
- Removes defensiveness
- Makes you a giver, not a taker

**Why this is foundational:** This principle is the bridge between individual coaching and team effectiveness. Individual coaching helps ME develop — but if it stays at "what I need," it doesn't build the team. The moment I can express my needs as "how I can better serve YOUR agenda," that's interdependence. Interdependence is what makes a team more than a group (more than the sum of its parts). **Without this reframe, individual coaching doesn't compound into team effectiveness.**

This is why coaching for teams requires this element. It's not just a conversational technique — it's the mechanism that transforms individual development into collective capability.

**Implication for product:** The AI coach must help users discover what they need FROM others, reframe it in terms of the other's agenda, and practice expressing it that way. This is how individual coaching serves the team.

---

### DP4: Individual Skills Enable Collective Performance

> "No se puede armar una jugada sin varios jugadores... pero necesitas que los jugadores individualmente tengan habilidades individuales."

Individual skills (listening, speaking truth, checking inferences) are prerequisites for collective skills (good conversations, resolving disagreements). You can't skip the individual level.

**Implication for product:** Start with individual coaching. It's the foundation for team effectiveness.

---

### DP5: Role Modeling Creates Moments of Truth

> "A través del role modeling, es como que creamos esos momentos de verdad que hacen que se ancle el aprendizaje."

When a coach demonstrates an alternative way to say something, in the moment, it creates an "aha" that sticks for years.

**Implication for product:** Can AI demonstrate alternative phrasings? Can it help users practice in a safe space before real conversations?

---

### DP6: Non-Negotiable Values Underpin Everything

The CB philosophy has non-negotiable principles:
- Player vs Victim (own your life)
- Learner vs Knower (stay curious)
- Essential Integrity (behavior aligned with values moment to moment)
- System optimization (suboptimize subsystems to optimize the whole)

**Implication for product:** These are the "constitution" of the AI coach. They shape what the system encourages and what it won't help with.

---

### DP7: Zero Attachment to Direction

> "Puedes hacer sugerencias, lo que no puedes es quedarte pegado a tu sugerencia."

The coach offers perspectives tentatively. If the coachee doesn't embrace it, fine. Zero attachment to pushing in a particular direction.

**Implication for product:** The AI shouldn't push users toward predetermined outcomes. It should offer and let go.

---

### DP8: Don't Announce, Model First

> "No salgan a comunicar nada, más bien que practiquen... de manera que la gente les pregunte qué están haciendo, qué está pasando con ellos, y ahí comunicar atrás de los comportamientos."

Don't announce golden rules of behavior. Practice first, let people notice what's different, then communicate. Announcing rules creates skepticism → cynicism.

**Implication for product:** The system should help users practice and embody changes, not just declare intentions. Change happens through doing, not announcing.

---

### DP9: Consultant Coherence

> "El consultor ofrece una gran coherencia interna entre lo que está diciendo y cómo se comporta."

The coach/consultant must embody what they teach. Credibility comes from alignment between what you say and how you act. The consultant "se comporta generando confianza, seguridad psicológica, se comporta diciendo su verdad."

**Implication for product:** The AI coach's "behavior" (how it interacts) must be consistent with CB principles. It should model curiosity, psychological safety, speaking truth, etc.

---

## 2. Methodology References

Frameworks, concepts, how things connect.

### Three Dimensions of Team Effectiveness (I / Wi / It)

| Dimension | Focus | Indicators |
|-----------|-------|------------|
| **I** (Individual) | Person inspired by project | Engagement, career fit |
| **Wi** (We) | Relationship quality | Trust, psychological safety, no undiscussables |
| **It** (Purpose) | Collective meaning | Team has unique contribution beyond company mission |

**Source:** Katzenbach + Axialent adaptation

---

### Three Intervention Tracks

| Track | What happens | Purpose |
|-------|--------------|---------|
| **Offsites** | Philosophy + business context | Learn frameworks using real business problems |
| **Meeting Facilitation** | Business + philosophy in background | Catch behaviors in flow, help honor stated intentions |
| **Individual Coaching** | Person + team context | Build skills that enable collective interdependence |

---

### CB Mental Models Referenced

- Player vs Victim
- Learner vs Knower
- Essential Integrity
- System vs Subsystem optimization ("Suma Cero")
- Ladder of Inference (ascending/descending)
- Impeccability

---

### Subject-Object Theory

> "Cuando tú eres sujeto de algo, no lo ves. Para verlo tenés que moverte afuera y hacerlo objeto de tu análisis."

Moving from subject to object = increasing consciousness. The coaching intervention helps people make their automatic patterns visible (object) rather than invisible (subject).

---

### Giver vs Taker Framework

> "Are you a giver or are you a taker?"

In every interaction: Are you adding resources to the pool or taking from it? This question underlies all interventions.

---

### Problems vs Polarities

> "Una polaridad no se resuelve por definición, solo puede disolverse a través de buenas conversaciones, cuando te das cuenta que los polos están al servicio de un bien superior."

As people grow in organizations, problems become complex — multiple interdependent solutions, tensions, polarities. You can't resolve a polarity like a problem. Polarities dissolve through conversations that reveal how the poles serve a higher good. Until then, it looks like "who's right and who's wrong."

---

### Knower → Learner Shift

> "Cuando tú crees que tienes las respuestas, dejas de preguntar."

Expert problem-solvers become "knowers" who stop asking questions. The intervention: asking doesn't mean abandoning your position — it's inviting enrichment. "Era simplemente darle a otro la posibilidad de que te enriqueciera."

---

### Coaching as "Powerful Lens"

> "Invitar a la gente a mirar a través de filtros más poderosos."

A description of what coaching fundamentally does: inviting people to see through more powerful filters. The filter change is what enables different action.

---

### "Ayúdame a Ayudarte" — Theoretical Grounding

The "ayúdame a ayudarte" reframe aligns with team effectiveness theory:

- **Social Interdependence Theory** (Deutsch, Johnson & Johnson) — Positive interdependence (my success linked to your success) is what enables cooperation. The reframe creates this link behaviorally.
- **Katzenbach & Smith** — A team (vs. group) is defined by *mutual accountability*. "Help me help you" makes accountability mutual, not just upward.
- **Hackman** — Beyond task interdependence, teams need *psychological interdependence* — feeling that we need each other. The reframe creates this even when task structure doesn't force it.

**Bottom line:** Interdependence is what distinguishes a team from a group. "Ayúdame a ayudarte" is a behavioral mechanism for creating that interdependence in everyday conversations.

---

## 3. Digitization Ideas

Product possibilities, what could be built.

### ID1: AI Individual Coaching as Foundation

> "Si podemos hacer que un AI te dé coaching relativamente bueno, con eso podemos diseñar muchas cosas que ayuden a un equipo."

**The insight:** If you can do 1:1 coaching with AI, that opens up many possibilities for team-level interventions. Individual coaching is the foundation — group interfaces are harder.

**Note:** The assessment that AI coaching is "working pretty well" was Ruy's observation shared in the conversation, not Richi's claim.

---

### ID2: Scale Individual Coaching

> "Si le quitas la limitante de que tener coaching individual es estúpidamente caro y de repente está para todos."

**The opportunity:** Individual coaching is currently too expensive to scale. AI removes the cost barrier, making it available to everyone on a team.

---

### ID3: Dashboard for Meeting Behaviors

> "Tener un dashboard que pueda levantar cuántas preguntas se hicieron en la reunión, cuántas inferencias no chequeadas hicieron."

**Possible metrics:**
- Questions asked vs statements made
- Unchecked inferences
- Interruptions
- Speaking time distribution

**Appeal:** "Para los clientes que les gusta ver en una matriz o en un Excel números."

---

### ID4: Real-Time Meeting Feedback

> "He visto sistemas que las intervenciones con el equipo es visualizations of how the reunion... hay cosas que podríamos hacer en tiempo real para que de repente te des cuenta si estás siendo muy knower o no."

**Possibility:** Real-time feedback during meetings (harder technically, but possible).

---

### ID5: Role Play / Practice Space

From DP5: The coach demonstrates alternative phrasings in the moment.

**Product idea:** AI helps users practice difficult conversations before having them. "What if you said it this way instead?"

---

### ID6: Program = Individual Coaching + Team Reflection

> "Hacer programas en donde el trabajo más fuerte se da en coaching individual y luego hay cierta reflexión en equipo sobre cómo están yendo las cosas, quizá facilitada por una persona."

**Product structure:**
- Heavy lifting: AI individual coaching
- Periodic: Human-facilitated team reflection
- Hybrid model that scales

---

## Design Challenge: Creating Moments of Truth in AI

### Why This Matters

The gap between espoused values and values-in-action is the raw material. But **how** you surface that gap determines whether learning anchors. In human coaching, the coach is in the room, catching it live. How does AI do this?

### What Happened in the Mini-Coaching Session

Richi demonstrated an in-session contradiction:
- Ruy was saying things about his frustration
- There was implicit context: "I don't want to be a victim, I want to do something"
- This shared value (player vs victim) allowed Richi to find contradictions even without full context
- He named it: "No me estás ayudando a ayudarte"

**Key insight:** Shared values with users help find contradictions even without full situational context. The CB principles (player, learner, integrity) create a frame for noticing gaps.

### Possible Approaches for AI

| Approach | How it works | Notes |
|----------|--------------|-------|
| **Pattern recognition over time** | AI notices recurring themes, contradictions across sessions | KEY - discussed extensively with Horacio (CB assessment methodology). Maintaining the thread across sessions is crucial. |
| **In-session contradictions** | User says X, then says something contradictory. AI names it gently. | What Richi did in real-time |
| **Role play as practice** | Before a conversation, practice with AI playing the other person | Skill to build in AI coach |
| **Post-conversation reflection** | "How did it go? What did you actually say vs. what you planned?" | Follow-up of conversations |

### Design Questions to Resolve

1. How does AI detect the gap without being in the room?
   - From user's recollection/stories
   - From patterns in how user talks to AI over time
   - From contradictions between what user says and what user reports doing

2. How does AI maintain thread across sessions?
   - Memory of past conversations
   - Tracking commitments and follow-ups
   - Noticing when same issue keeps appearing

3. What creates emotional engagement with AI?
   - Real content (their actual situations, not hypotheticals)
   - Gentle but direct naming of contradictions
   - Feeling heard/understood before being challenged

4. How does AI demonstrate alternatives (role modeling)?
   - Suggest alternative phrasings
   - Role play practice conversations
   - Show the contrast between what they said and what they could say

## 4. Action Items

### For Ruy

- [ ] **Send Richi resources:** AI podcast (OpenAI coach), book on history of intelligence
- [ ] **Review Application Coaching Manual** — re-read with focus on design principles
- [ ] **Contact Dolo** — request Facilitator Guides (e.g., Meli), proposals that explain coaching/facilitation/offsites
- [ ] **Process the "ayúdame a ayudarte" conversation** — consider having this with Oseas
- [ ] **Schedule follow-up with Richi** — after he reviews materials

### For Vision Document

- [ ] **Add design principles** from this call to team-effectiveness-vision.md
- [ ] **Document the two "aha moment" types** as core to the methodology
- [ ] **Clarify MVP sequence:** Individual coaching → Team reflection (human facilitated) → Dashboard (later)

### Open Questions

1. **How do we create "moments of truth" in AI?** The gap between espoused and actual values needs to be surfaced. How does the AI do this without being in the room?

2. **What's the "constitution" of our AI coach?** The non-negotiable CB principles (player, learner, integrity, system optimization) — how do we embed these?

3. **Dashboard timing:** Richi sees value, but it's technically harder. When does this enter the roadmap?

## Synthesis for Team Effectiveness Vision

**What this call clarifies:**

1. **Start with individual coaching** — it's technically achievable and foundational for team effectiveness
2. **The intervention creates the gap** — assessments + coaching help people SEE the gap between who they are and who they want to be
3. **Two types of aha moments:**
   - Espoused vs values-in-action
   - "Ayúdame a ayudarte" — discovering what you need from others
4. **The "magic" isn't in the documentation** — it's in the live demonstration, the role modeling, the real-time intervention. This is what we need to figure out how to digitize.
5. **Opinionated methodology is the differentiator** — CB principles are non-negotiable. This is our "constitution."
