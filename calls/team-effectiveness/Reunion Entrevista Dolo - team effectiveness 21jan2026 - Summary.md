## Executive Summary

Dolo explains Axialent's High Performing Teams (HPT) methodology — a process that combines team-level and individual-level interventions. The key insight is that **HPT is not a separate methodology but a combination of existing components** (coaching, teaching, facilitation) applied to teams. The only unique skill for HPT is **meeting facilitation**, which is the hardest to digitize.

**The process structure:**
1. **Context** — Understand team, objectives, desired outcomes
2. **Diagnostic** — Team assessment (Lencioni or Katzenbach) + individual assessment (DISC, LSI, LI)
3. **Interventions** — Workshops (content foreground), meeting facilitation (content background), coaching (individual + group)
4. **Tracking** — Self-reported progress, leader conversations, periodic re-measurement

**On digitization:**
Dolo sees HPT as "human-led" by necessity — teams need trust-building conversations that can't be replaced. However, AI coaches could complement individual coaching and help prepare difficult conversations. Assessment collection and tracking (Team Pulse) are prime candidates for digitization.

## HPT Process Structure

### Phase 1: Context & Alignment

| What | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| Team configuration | How long together, roles, history |
| Organization role | Where team sits, strategic importance |
| Objectives | What success looks like for this process |
| Anticipated gaps | Where leader already sees opportunities |

### Phase 2: Diagnostic

**Two parallel tracks:**

| Level | What you assess | Instruments |
|-------|-----------------|-------------|
| **Team Dynamics** | How team functions against HPT model | Lencioni (5 dysfunctions), Katzenbach (4 dimensions), internal Team Pulse, OCI, Group Styles Inventory |
| **Individual Leadership** | How each leader's style affects team dynamics | DISC, LSI, Leadership Impact (LI) |

**Key insight:** You always work BOTH levels simultaneously. Individual patterns contribute to team dynamics.

### Phase 3: Interventions

| Mechanism | Content | Philosophy | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|------------|---------|
| **Workshops** | Foreground | Background | Teach frameworks, build agreements, clarify purpose/roles |
| **Group Coaching** | Challenges | Foreground | Work team challenges with coaching approach |
| **Meeting Facilitation** | Background | Foreground | Intervene in actual business meetings to improve dynamics |
| **Individual Coaching** | Person | Team context | Build individual skills that enable collective performance |

**Workshop topics (depends on diagnostic):**
- Team purpose clarification
- Role clarity (Team RACI)
- Operating agreements
- Accountability/commitments
- Strategic alignment
- Mindsets (CB fundamentals)

### Phase 4: Tracking

- Self-reported by team members
- Leader conversations
- Periodic feedback post-interventions
- Re-measurement (Team Pulse) at intervals
- Quick wins visible early; deeper change takes longer

## What Exists vs. What Doesn't

| Component | Documentation |
|-----------|---------------|
| Coaching | Coaching Handbook, Application Coaching manual |
| Teaching/Workshops | Playbook for delivery |
| Meeting Facilitation | Skilled Facilitator (Schwartz) — external framework |
| HPT as integrated offering | **No unified manual** — consultant combines components |

**Key quote:**
> "No hay un manual, porque las intervenciones varían mucho de equipo a equipo... El consultor entiende cómo se combinan los elementos."

---

## Digitization Potential

### What Can Be Digitized

| Element | Digital approach |
|---------|------------------|
| Assessment collection | Team Pulse (quanti), structured interviews (quali) |
| Data analysis | AI pattern recognition on diagnostic data |
| Meeting minutes | AI-generated with human review |
| Pre-workshop prep | Wizards to guide teams through exercises |
| Individual coaching | AI coach as complement |
| Conversation prep | AI helps prepare difficult conversations |
| Progress tracking | Periodic pulse checks, trend visualization |
| Benchmarking | Aggregate historical data for industry comparisons |

### What Must Stay Human-Led

| Element | Why |
|---------|-----|
| Diagnostic interpretation | Context matters, AI doesn't know nuances |
| Trust-building sessions | Initial workshops need human facilitation |
| Meeting facilitation | Real-time intervention requires human judgment |
| Final decisions | Human checkpoint on all outputs |

**Dolo's position:**
> "Yo creo que tiene que ser human led en general... Recontra utilizaría, y voy a proponer que usemos los AI coaches, por ejemplo para complemento de la parte de coaching individual o incluso del coaching de equipo para preparar conversaciones difíciles."

---

## Historical Data Opportunity

Dolo has historical data from all HPT processes until 2019 (and some ongoing). This data was never analyzed systematically.

**Potential uses:**
- Understand patterns across teams
- Create benchmarks by industry/size/challenge type
- Train models on what works

**Blocker:** Data infrastructure is "a disaster" — needs cleanup this year as foundation for everything else.

## Key Quotes

> "No hay tanto más detalle... El consultor entiende cómo se combinan los elementos."

> "Tiene que ser human led en general... pero por ejemplo, recontra utilizaría los AI coaches para complemento de la parte de coaching individual."

> "Necesitas el stewardship, necesitas la revisión de que eso tiene sentido."

> "La parte de skill building es la misma... tenés que mirarlo distinto, por eso tenés que entender el framework con el que lo estás mirando."

> "Sin esa confianza, no puedes tener la verdad indiscutibles, no puedes tener conversaciones difíciles."
