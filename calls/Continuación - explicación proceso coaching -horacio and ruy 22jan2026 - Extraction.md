## 1. Design Principles

How should coaching/team development work?

### DP1: Context Shapes Design

> "Una cosa es que nos contrate un cliente para ayudar a que el equipo comercial mejore su efectividad como equipo... Si se trata de que el equipo es una parte de un proyecto mayor, podría ocurrir que los miembros de ese equipo ya han participado de talleres."

The same "HPT intervention" looks completely different depending on whether:
- It's a **standalone** team engagement (full diagnostic, teaching, coaching)
- It's **part of culture transformation** (team arrives "pre-warmed," skip foundations, focus on application)

**Implication for product:** Can't assume a standard "HPT program." Need to know the context — is this team already in a CB/culture journey or starting fresh?

---

### DP2: Two Types of Diagnostic Serve Different Purposes

| Type | What It Measures | What It Guides |
|------|------------------|----------------|
| **Behavioral** (LSI, OCI) | Individual/team behavior patterns | What behaviors need to change, CB skill gaps |
| **Team Functioning** (4-Quadrant) | How well the team operates as a team | What the team needs to work on (purpose, roles, processes, relationships) |

**Key insight:** These are complementary, not redundant. 4-Quadrant tells you WHERE the team is broken. Behavioral assessments tell you HOW individuals contribute to that brokenness.

**Implication for product:** Any team assessment should cover both dimensions — team functioning AND individual behavioral patterns.

---

### DP3: Diagnostic Drives Agenda

> "Si en promedio ese equipo contestó que claridad de roles está en 1.5 en promedio, bueno, claramente eso lo voy a poner como agenda para abrir una conversación."

The diagnostic results aren't just for awareness — they directly determine what you work on in offsites and interventions. Low score on roles? That's the agenda. Low score on relationships? That's where CB teaching comes in.

**Implication for product:** Assessment should produce actionable recommendations, not just scores. "You scored low on X, here's the intervention for that."

---

### DP4: Materials Don't Self-Explain

> "Los materiales no se autoexplican — va a ser importante que las conversaciones que podamos tener tú y yo al respecto."

Documentation alone isn't enough to transfer HPT knowledge. The tacit knowledge requires conversation, observation, and iteration.

**Implication for product:** Can't just "digitize the manual." Need to capture the reasoning, the judgment calls, the why behind decisions.

---

### DP5: Balance Investment Across Levels

Horacio noted the Western Union case was unusual — CEO got 6 coaching sessions, team got nothing individual. His assessment:

> "Esa desajuste yo creo que no lo he visto en otros proyectos y mi opinión es que no lo recomendaría tampoco."

Normal design: If leader gets individual attention, team members should too (maybe less, but not zero).

**Implication for product:** If building a team effectiveness product, don't design something that only serves leaders. Team members need their own development path.

---

## 2. Methodology References

Frameworks, concepts, how things connect.

### The 4-Quadrant Model (Axialent HPT)

| Quadrant | Focus | What You Work On |
|----------|-------|------------------|
| **Purpose/Values/Objectives** | Why the team exists | Mission clarity, goal alignment, shared vision |
| **Roles & Responsibilities** | Who does what | RACI, accountability, ownership clarity |
| **Processes** | How work gets done | Meeting effectiveness, decision-making, coordination |
| **Relationships** | Quality of conversations | Trust, CB skills, psychological safety |

**Key insight:** The Relationships quadrant is where CB teaching becomes most relevant. The other quadrants are more structural/operational.

> "Cuando trabajamos sobre el cuadrante de relaciones, es lo que más directamente justifica el teaching del modelo de conscious business."

---

### 4-Quadrant as Operationalization of Katzenbach

> "El modelo de cuatro cuadrantes es como la operacionalización del de Katzenbach."

Katzenbach provides the theory. The 4-Quadrant model provides:
- A diagnostic instrument (survey with scaled questions)
- A visual output (concentric circles showing development)
- A guide for intervention design (which quadrant to focus on)

---

### HPT Engagement Timeline (Western Union Example)

```
Pre-Project
├── HR contact (initial conversation)
├── CEO trust-building meeting
└── Project approval

Diagnostic Phase
├── Interviews (feedback on leader + team)
├── LSI for all team members
├── OCI (team culture — current or desired)
└── 4-Quadrant assessment

Launch
└── Kickoff meeting with full team

Delivery
├── Individual track: LSI debrief + coaching (leader)
├── Group track: LSI group debrief + Offsites
└── Application: Facilitated business meetings

Ongoing
└── Facilitator in real meetings → feedback → iterate
```

---

### Two Ways to Open the Gap

**Option 1: With OCI Desired**
- Run OCI to capture desired team culture
- Compare against LSI results
- Gap = what each person needs to change to achieve desired culture

**Option 2: Without OCI (fallback)**
- Use "ideal historical" from Human Synergistics
- LSI results vs. known ideal profile (blues high, greens/reds contained)
- Less customized but still creates a behavioral gap

> "Siempre tenemos la oportunidad de abrir una brecha comportamental."

---

### LSI Group Debrief Process

When LSI debriefs are done GROUP (not individual):
1. Each person receives their individual report (printed)
2. Facilitator guides 2-hour session explaining how to interpret circumplex
3. Each person identifies their own strengths and opportunities
4. Each person leaves with self-development priorities identified
5. What they DO with those priorities depends on offsites and facilitated meetings

No individual coaching for team members in this model — they learn through group experiences and application.

---

## 3. Digitization Ideas

Product possibilities, what could be built.

### ID1: 4-Quadrant Digital Assessment

The 4-Quadrant assessment already exists as a survey. Could be digitized:
- Online survey (6-8 questions per quadrant, 1-5 scale)
- Automated visualization (concentric circles showing development)
- Benchmarking across teams
- Tracking over time (pulse re-measurement)

**Horacio already shared this exists internally.** Dolo also mentioned wanting Team Pulse. Could be same product.

---

### ID2: Diagnostic → Intervention Recommendation Engine

If 4-Quadrant identifies weak areas, system could recommend:
- "Roles & Responsibilities is low — here's the RACI workshop"
- "Relationships is low — here's the CB teaching module"
- "Processes is low — here's meeting effectiveness content"

Connect assessment results to specific interventions.

---

### ID3: LSI Group Debrief Companion

Horacio describes a 2-hour group debrief process. Could AI help:
- Guide individuals through interpreting their own LSI
- Help identify top development priorities
- Connect LSI patterns to specific CB skills
- Track progress over time

Not replacing the group experience, but supporting individual reflection before/after.

---

### ID4: Pre/Post Offsite Support

Before offsite:
- AI helps collect 4-Quadrant responses
- AI processes and visualizes results
- AI suggests agenda based on weak areas

After offsite:
- AI helps individuals track commitments
- AI prompts reflection on application
- AI connects to coaching for deeper work

---

## 4. Action Items

### For Ruy

- [ ] Request Western Union case materials from Horacio (with confidentiality)
- [ ] Request 4-Quadrant assessment instrument
- [ ] Request Horacio's offsite agendas/materials
- [ ] Request interview guide template
- [ ] Follow up with questions by email (as agreed)
- [ ] Compare 4-Quadrant model with Dolo's Team Pulse plans

### Open Questions

1. **4-Quadrant vs Team Pulse:** Are these the same thing? Different? Should we build one product or reconcile?
2. **LSI/OCI dependency:** How much does HPT rely on Human Synergistics instruments? Can we work without them?
3. **Relationships quadrant = CB:** If this is the quadrant most connected to CB, is that the entry point for AI coaching in teams?

---

## Synthesis for Team Effectiveness Vision

**What this call clarifies:**

1. **4-Quadrant model is the operational guide.** It tells you WHERE the team needs work. The assessment → visualization → agenda is a clear workflow that could be digitized.

2. **Two diagnostic types are complementary.** Behavioral (LSI/OCI) tells you what individuals need to change. Team functioning (4-Quadrant) tells you what the team needs to work on. Both matter.

3. **Context shapes everything.** Standalone HPT vs. part of culture transformation are very different designs. Product needs to account for this.

4. **Relationships quadrant = CB entry point.** This is where CB teaching becomes most relevant in team context. Could be the bridge between individual coaching and team effectiveness.

5. **Materials don't self-explain.** Tacit knowledge requires conversation. Digitization alone won't transfer the expertise — need to capture the reasoning.
