Ruy
talked. Uh so w I was thinking that i uh I mean if we spend um the first uh fifty minutes uh to know how you're doing, uh what you're up to. I mean uh work wise and so on. Um and then we talk about this specific feature.

Speaker 1
I think we we have spoken yeah about we have some kind of one-to-one, maybe two ago.

Ruy
Oh yeah, it was two weeks ago. Yes.

Speaker 1
Um seems good. Everything is good. I don't know. I don't have anything on my mind. Just to tell specifically

Ruy
Okay. Well let's let's chat for a few minutes and uh if we finish early that's fine. Este

Speaker 1
Yeah, also I have told you like I I don't know like um perhaps too much data meetings

Ruy
So yeah, I saw your message

Speaker 1
Yeah, and but I think we need some kind of gather meetings but uh like a really little one

Ruy
Yeah, for technical stuff is the Yeah, no, I uh uh when you when you wrote it when I saw it it it it makes uh a lot of sense to me. Uh I think we need it and when and I I didn't um It's good that you bring it up.

Speaker 2
Yeah.

Ruy
So so I will I think that If we do like uh I don't know maybe half an hour every week that would be fine. That would be sufficient

Speaker 1
Yeah I think in my previous work we also like two times a week for half an hour not so long.

Speaker 2
Maybe it's longer if we have some some really hard problems, but sometimes it's it's all

Ruy
No, it it it makes a lot of sense.

Speaker 2
Doesn't mean a lot of time, um

Ruy
So I will check with Leo who's now is the taking care of of uh the operations and see when when is a better day from from the days of Gadr when is a better day for us to align on that To have that space is the It's uh it's a good idea. Um I'm taking a note here. Yeah. And And it I mean it it h how how do you feel now about uh Or not feel but uh rather uh I think Mike no but you were out of the all the other quick because now Mike uh uh built the some features in Reflex and I think he documented his process. Had you had a chance to talk to him or not really?

Speaker 2
Uh not this week. Yeah, I'm just Yeah, I'll maybe we'll have a would we have spring demo or sprint meeting this week? I think here I

Ruy
It's not demo tomorrow is just uh I have to in fact I have to change it. Because I have another meeting, uh uh emergent meeting is the it's only refinement is the

Speaker 1
Yeah, maybe he will spend some time to show how he build like maybe 105 minutes, 10 minutes.

Ruy
Yeah.

Speaker 2
So he said like it it wasn't hassle for him to work with a reflex.

Ruy
Yeah it was uh it was okay.

Speaker 2
It was quite easy.

Ruy
Uh uh is the escape I think he has now a very Mature, well thought uh workflow. Um So that seems to be the the key

Speaker 2
Okay

Ruy
So I I I think it's uh it's it's a matter of um just Checking his his workflow and see how he's uh making things uh the I'm gonna use this extreme log Yeah, just checking his workflow and and seeing what's uh maybe what was missing for you. Yeah, okay

Speaker 2
Yeah, okay.

Ruy
Basically. Yeah, because as I yeah, I mean I've been I've been working With ourselves and so on uh in in um building the the roadmap for for this year and I think we'll be doing quite a bit of um application uh yeah like uh screens and dashboards and things like that. So we need um We will be needing reflex.

Speaker 2
How is Daniel?

Ruy
How is Daniel Daniel?

Speaker 2
I haven't seen him. Yeah, he's good?

Ruy
He's fine. He and his wife are or his wife and him are expecting a baby. And uh it's gonna be due by um Mid next mid um February mid February Okay, yeah.

Speaker 2
Okay, yeah. Because he's like he's not talking in the chat, like I don't see him um okay.

Ruy
I don't see him okay. Maybe Yeah, I guess um I guess they are preparing for the baby and he's

Speaker 2
Maybe uh

Ruy
A bit out of the loop. I need to talk to him to to see what the plan is and see what the status is. Because did you ask him for anything in particular? Oh no, no.

Speaker 2
Uh no, no.

Ruy
Um

Speaker 2
Um

Ruy
No, no, not sure.

Speaker 2
No no actually.

Ruy
Um yeah, I'm just asking maybe.

Speaker 2
I'm just asking maybe.

Ruy
Um no uh I don't have anything on him

Speaker 2
No, uh I don't have anything on him.

Ruy
Yeah, because uh let me check. What Daniel is doing right now

Speaker 2
What Daniel is doing right now, like I can um

Ruy
Daniel, he's supposed he's uh working on the environment environment creating creation automation And uh the script is the like new virtual machines, new databases

Speaker 2
Like new virtual machines, new databases.

Ruy
Yeah, when we need to especially when when uh when new clients come and they need to set up or we need to set up all the

Speaker 2
That's kind of stuff.

Ruy
We need to set up a new environment for a new client or for testing a new feature. He's he's working on on um on a script that automates that because right now is the Mike is the only one that can do it and it takes him like half a day. So the these two automated is the And also maybe automating other things that uh that we need. He's he's going to refinements um to demo.

Speaker 2
He's he's going to refinements um to demo I think he's invited, he should be invited.

Ruy
I think he's invited, he should be invited He's invited for for the meetings is the he's invited for the meetings but um Yeah, how long have he last week? Oh okay.

Speaker 2
Oh okay, okay.

Ruy
I thought like he was like fifty fifty he's going or not going.

Speaker 1
I thought like he was like 50-50 he's going or not going.

Ruy
On the way

Speaker 1
I don't know.

Ruy
Sorry?

Speaker 3
Uh I thought like he was like 50-50 his uh sometimes his guy see him, sometimes I don't see him.

Ruy
I thought like he was like 50-50 he's uh sometimes he's guys see he's sometimes he's uh sometimes he doesn't come um I think uh no, I asked him to be at the demos and at the planning Uh but sometimes the refinement he he's not able to come um So let's go to fuck uh checking uh uh his um like to Asana maybe

Speaker 2
So let's go to fuck uh fuck checking uh uh his um like to Asana maybe

Ruy
Yeah, no, uh I was thinking that uh yeah, I I I I pause because I was uh looking at the things that we need to discuss. And one of the things that we need to discuss is um your usage of um Let me let me take a look one second Este es el The usage of um Of Cloud Cost Tokens, este I think it's a Because right now you have your I mean you you have a pro account and uh and you plugged in the The API key is the I don't use API key for cloud code.

Speaker 2
I don't use API key for cloud code.

Ruy
No, just my wrong subscription.

Speaker 2
No, just my round subscription.

Ruy
No, I think you do. Or else I need to Can you show like I don't know

Speaker 2
Can you show like I don't know this is strange actually

Ruy
It's strange. Yeah, because uh the same thing happened to to or or uh the similar a similar thing is uh happened to Mike uh because he has his own subscription and um but still I got Uh uh bills for hundred and ninety dollars last week and it was mainly because he had a hidden a hidden key uh somewhere in his um

Speaker 2
Yeah.

Ruy
So there there is this weird place where um I don't know specifically where But it seems that he was using it. So there is this there is a key. Let me show you. I clean up quite a bit, but there is a kill that uh that I gave you a w uh A while back This is Can you click somewhere and maybe

Speaker 2
Can you click somewhere and maybe like maybe it will tell like in which project uh it is used or some metadata.

Ruy
Like maybe it will tell like in which project uh it is used or some metadata. No, I don't know where it is used. This is the uh the beginning of and the end of the key.

Speaker 2
P E A okay

Ruy
And that's um I mean, probably that's what you're using locally.

Speaker 2
Mm. Huh. Mm-hmm.

Ruy
I'll just take a look at my project.

Speaker 2
I'll just take a look at My project, I don't know.

Ruy
Maybe you can grab for it and see where it is. It is this month, yes, or yeah, it is this month.

Speaker 2
It is this month, yes? Or

Ruy
This month in January Well court uh

Speaker 2
World court.

Ruy
Take take a look and tell me. So maybe I will delete it in uh yeah just delete it.

Speaker 2
Yeah, just delete it. Yeah.

Ruy
Yeah That's sure, really.

Speaker 2
Not sure really.

Ruy
Just as a

Speaker 2
This is

Ruy
I mean what was in this month I was using only conscious and I was working conscious and size repository

Speaker 4
In this month I was using only conscious and I was working conscious insights repository. And like for private things I use cloud code subscription, just uh cursor uh cursor uh this is

Ruy
And like for private things I use cloud code subscription just uh cursor uh cursor uh it's

Speaker 2
How it's called extension.

Ruy
Oh, it's called extension system.

Speaker 2
It's this sounds

Ruy
Yeah, uh So what I'm thinking is to set up a ma oh so uh create a max account for you uh with the hundred dollar subscription Este so you can have that

Speaker 2
Okay.

Ruy
But I need to do it Ha, you remove uh the uh IPI key and my cloud code extension turn off

Speaker 1
Ha you remove uh the IPI key and my cloud code extension turn off.

Ruy
Yeah no I mean extension oh my goodness most probably it was so let's fix that uh right now

Speaker 1
Funny. It was extension. Oh my goodness.

Speaker 2
Yeah, super strange.

Ruy
Yeah, that's okay.

Speaker 2
Yeah, that's okay. At least we found the case.

Ruy
At least we found the case. Yeah.

Speaker 2
Found the

Ruy
Found the I just uh I just I'm I'm I'm trying to is To enter to your email so it sent you a code Did you call it? I cannot listen to you, you're on uh I didn't get it.

Speaker 2
Uh yeah, I didn't get it.

Ruy
Maybe need to wait a couple of minutes.

Speaker 2
Maybe need to wait a couple of minutes. Um

Ruy
Most probably I just Should be or something. No, I know what happened. I didn't shit No, est-ce que I uh I misspelled your email So we have to I mean you we have to do this because um

Speaker 2
Yeah.

Ruy
Okay, so we check now.

Speaker 2
Yeah, secure link, security.

Ruy
Secure link Can you can you give me that link? A verification code, you mean?

Speaker 2
Uh verification code, you mean or yeah seven seven six eight three seven

Ruy
Uh the verification call or the link, whatever. Seven, seven, six, eight, three, seven Okay, a ver, este uh uh uh uh uh uh You have to ask for a code and set Kind of a pain to set it up, este or the Uh uh uh Six Studio Okay. Seems to be set up este

Speaker 2
Yeah, go on.

Ruy
So It's the so don't turn off this. You know, don't turn on this Extra usage because otherwise the same thing happens. But now you have a math account and this should you This should get you uh I thought like why I cannot uh cannot hit the limit in cloud quote

Speaker 1
I thought like why I cannot I cannot hit the limit in cloud code because sometimes I use extensions, sometimes I use the uh use the console.

Ruy
Because sometimes I use the extension, sometimes I use the no uh you do the composite. Uh they are they are they are sneaky because you do

Speaker 2
That's strange too.

Ruy
You do hit them but they don't tell you uh actively. All right, cursor settings. Now I will turn off the Yeah, so yeah, it's I thought

Speaker 2
Yeah, so yeah, it's settled.

Ruy
So the cursor I put uh A limit of one hundred and fifty. In fact, we don't Is the you are I'm gonna completely disable the on-demand usage of uh or coursing.

Speaker 2
Yeah this

Ruy
Yes, yes I mean right now I think it's mostly autocomplete so uh This mod we didn't have any any usage but I would just turn it off so there is no problem. Okay.

Speaker 2
Okay.

Ruy
There is the

Speaker 2
Yeah.

Ruy
Okay, so now that sort this is the Just uh System and okay, now let's go to The tasks So just to uh to know um were you able to fix the work OS cookie thing?

Speaker 2
Uh yeah, Mike, fix it.

Ruy
Uh yeah, Mike fixed it. Yeah.

Speaker 2
Yeah.

Ruy
When you fix it yet.

Speaker 2
We fix it yet.

Ruy
So okay.

Speaker 2
So

Ruy
What was the problem? The problem with the redirect is uh Oh ready reacts?

Speaker 4
The problem with the redirects. This is the Yeah because like loc in on local machine when you work you should redirect

Ruy
Yeah Because like loc in on local machine when you work should redirect to the local

Speaker 4
to the local some local host and when deployed you should redirect to the domain name you are working on

Ruy
some local host uh and when deployed you should redirect to the domain name you are working on Uh-huh.

Speaker 4
This is a really strange issue and and yeah I was I was able to make it work on uh like production domain but on local host it doesn't work on either

Ruy
This is a really strange issue and and yeah I was was able to make it work on uh like production domain button local host it doesn't work for either other way and there was a issue with um

Speaker 4
for the way in there was a issue with um like a dynamic re uh dynamic redirect

Ruy
like a dynamic re dynamic redirect uh with a work OS.

Speaker 4
um with the work OS.

Ruy
I think it's not documente documented so much.

Speaker 4
I think it's not documente documented so much. Um yeah this is a cr really strange issue.

Ruy
Yeah, this is a cr really strange issue. This is on s only about work OS.

Speaker 2
This is on s only about work OS

Ruy
But the good thing is that now it's uh now it's done. And uh also um were you able to to start uh looking at the thinking partner Yeah I had I was yeah, was doing some couple of conversations.

Speaker 2
Um I had I was yeah, was doing some couple of conversations. Yeah yeah, but just

Ruy
Yeah. Let me put it this way. Um how familiar did uh are you now with it? Do you do you want me to Este to explain you about how it works, configuration and so on.

Speaker 1
Yeah, I'm not clear like um there is like a goal extraction step uh you know like AI extract

Ruy
There is like a goal extraction step, uh you know, like AI extract.

Speaker 1
Uh when it's called like it's

Ruy
Uh when it's called like Okay, uh so let's talk about the este oh yeah shh

Speaker 2
If I'm just open profiles uh like uh tomo or like I don't know.

Ruy
So this is the configuration. Uh is the basically it looks like a uh All of these fields are are the normal fields for for configuration of any profile. The AI extract it's something that might develop but right now in the version that is committed it's not working and in fact I need you to work on it So the main idea is that there are a series of um different uh stages of the conversation And the idea is that you extract the main theme of each stage of the conversation and you show it And this is uh this is being extracted from the conversation in the in the um uh in the message loop. Ah so I'll I'll get back to this uh but right now that I continue to explain the what I would like you to to do for because it's basically to work on on this and polish it as a feature Este mod also the configuration sidebar is uh is true and then Also you can switch to all the different bridget profiles and the reason why is that it sends you to a bridge profile It's because these are different from the ordinary difficult conversations. I don't know if you if you took a look to the actual prompts

Speaker 2
Mm, just uh just a glance.

Ruy
Mmm just uh just a glance. Okay.

Speaker 2
Yeah.

Ruy
So let me instead open them a little bit Okay, so all the first part it's um how it I mean guidelines how it should go and so on then here the steps of uh context understanding path identif gap identification really understanding what's the the problem that you have and what's uh what's the state that you would like to be in And then here it will select which of the different profiles it will send you to depending on the gap that you have. So right now there are four, there could be more and and uh It it will detect is the um output uh of uh of this specific place So it sends you uh to the next profile to the bridget profile as um as we're calling it here and um

Speaker 2
Um

Ruy
And then if you go to the bridge profile Basically it uh it assumes that you already um Did the setup of the conversation in terms of understanding the context and uh and so on, and it goes applying. Sh it goes applying the uh uh the methodology uh for for you to uh resolve the problem that you have, the gap that you have, and then it does committing because you will commit to do something specific like have that conversation or whatever. And then it will ask you for feedback. So let's go to the

Speaker 2
Oh by the way, I cannot access this document.

Ruy
Oh by the way, I cannot access this document. This is strange but Which one?

Speaker 2
This is strange, but

Ruy
This one? The one that I sent yesterday Yeah in in Asana there is a link to full specification and I cannot access it.

Speaker 2
Yeah in in Asana uh there is a link to full specification and I cannot access it.

Ruy
This is strange.

Speaker 2
This is strange really Yeah um

Ruy
Yeah. No, this is emoji.

Speaker 2
No, this is emoji. You should like in the text click somewhere.

Ruy
You should like in the text click somewhere. Uh yeah. Now I'm just thinking I want to add any analogy. Yeah. Because you have some stoic full access numbers. Should be sh dot arslanov dot org

Speaker 2
Should be sh dot arslanov dot work. Um

Ruy
I don't have neither my accident.

Speaker 4
I don't have neither my X L ah

Ruy
Ah my goodness, I have another mail.

Speaker 4
Oh my goodness, I have another mail.

Ruy
Show me one, two, three, four, five.

Speaker 4
Show me one, two, three, four, five.

Ruy
Okay.

Speaker 4
Okay. My my problem.

Ruy
My my problem.

Speaker 4
Yeah.

Ruy
So should I should I change?

Speaker 4
So yeah.

Speaker 1
No no no this is good no yeah I just forgot as I ha I have a three males one working a male and two

Ruy
No. This is good now. Uh yeah, I just forgot as I I have three males, one working, a male and two Not for Max Alien too uh like working but yeah I need to try another one.

Speaker 1
One from Axiallient and two uh like working uh but yeah I need to try another one. Okay, I'll take a look.

Ruy
Yeah I'll take a look. Okay

Speaker 1
Um

Ruy
A ver, uh just check that you have access so we can go over the document Yeah, just one minute.

Speaker 2
Yeah, just one minute, I think.

Ruy
Yeah. Uh I'll I'll stick here. Add account.

Speaker 2
Add account

Ruy
Yeah, I have access.

Speaker 2
Yeah, I have access.

Ruy
Cool. Uh I mean, so the main idea is that uh When you're doing the is the when you're working with the thinking partner, uh I mean right now is the with uh the leadership growth partner there is a sidebar and it will continue um It's the it it it will fill up uh progressively as you go. Um So the idea with the thinking partner is the same thing is that you you uh it starts to fill up progressively. And the fields is that it extracts your challenge, goal, the gap. the approach, key insights and commitment. Okay.

Speaker 2
Okay, yeah

Ruy
So you're gonna take AI extract, which uh is probably not working And make it work. So you have uh something like this: you have the conversation, and then we have the six different um pieces that will go. Um that will be filled up uh as you progress in the conversation. Make sense?

Speaker 2
Yeah, yep, it's good.

Ruy
Yeah. Yep. And then I would like you to use these icons so they are part of Lucid React. It's a package that is already being used there Also in the sidebar the idea is that you can copy it, copy the summary And you copy a text of it. And that's it.

Speaker 2
Okay.

Ruy
It should I mean once the A extract is working it should be not very difficult to implement is the um The main idea here is that you become comfortable with developing things for conscious insights. So like uh AI extract should be called like every free user messages or

Speaker 2
So like uh AI extract should be called like every three user messages or

Ruy
Uh every one message should try to feel everything every message user.

Speaker 2
Every one message should try to feel everything. Every message user

Ruy
Uh I don't know that's a that's a good question for you to solve because right now let's say here is the So that's why I I um so when you are in this step of the prompt of context understanding Once it finishes this step, you should be able to fill up my challenge. You understand what's the context and what well sorry you understand the context and you finish let's say gap identification

Speaker 2
Uh uh, okay. Yeah, good

Ruy
And you can fill up the two and then when you go to gab acknowledgement You can fill up the gap. Um and once it offers you a framework And it tells you, okay, you could we could review this conversation because it seems that it's a difficult conversation. You can fill it up here in the approach and once you jump to the next uh Prompt you will be able to extract the insights as you finish the process And once you're done with the contracting, which is almost the last step, you will be able to To fill up your commitment. So it's really, it's progressively as you go on the conversation. Okay, I got it.

Speaker 2
Okay, I got it. It's my clear.

Ruy
So as the time when conversation goes to next step

Speaker 2
So is the time when conversation goes to next step just to the update it?

Ruy
Just to yeah, I mean the the tricky part is that all the steps here in the conversation they are They are not steps as they uh awesome. So they're just text text that chatbot outputs.

Speaker 2
Yeah, they're just text text that chat put outputs.

Ruy
Yes, it's just chatbot output.

Speaker 2
Yeah.

Ruy
It's um So I mean probably you can do this with prompting and just uh Ask the ask an LLM to infer that given this prompt and given how far you are, este I mean does the uh let's say does the user has identified the gap and acknowledge it? If so give me the gap And if not, wait for the next turn is the So that's one way of doing it and the other way let's see if if that way like lazy ways that we ask the LLM to do it for us. it uh it's sufficient um because the other thing would be to have the state inside like having a state machine that keeps track of the state that you're having in the conversation. I tell you

Speaker 2
You just woke up.

Ruy
You just woke up.

Speaker 2
Rui.

Ruy
Yes.

Speaker 2
I've been uh everywhere in Barcelona, yeah, many places.

Ruy
I've been uh everywhere in Barcelona, yeah many places.

Speaker 2
Yeah.

Ruy
Yeah, I mean let's let's see if the LLM catches it and and and does a good job. Uh and if not you will have to do something more complex like having a state machine. Don't you want like LLM after each step outputs some message and inside like a

Speaker 1
Don't you want like LLM after each step outputs Some message and inside like as far as I understood your gap is like just to output by text in the conversation.

Ruy
As far as I understood your gap is like just to output by text. Yeah, in fact if you go over the conversation uh it becomes very clear how how you advance uh over it. So there is a specific part where It asks you how important it's for you to breach this gap and then then you respond. Okay.

Speaker 2
Okay.

Ruy
So you will have to to um I think I'll take a look maybe

Speaker 2
Yeah. I think I'll take a look, maybe it would be

Ruy
It would be I mean there is there should be some simple solution of this.

Speaker 2
There is there should be some simple solution of this.

Ruy
I think the simplest solution is to run an LM call One second because I'm waiting on call. Well no Este yeah, I think the simple the most simple solution is uh to do an LM call after each user message is the and uh have a a prompt that uh takes this and is the and decide uh if if you're ready to fill up the gap. Fill out the the uh That's the summary. I think that should be enough You will have to work on the prompt a little bit and do a uh uh some tests. So So uh So you will be working right now on that and let's see how how it goes and uh And then uh probably I'll uh give another task. Okay, that's good.

Speaker 2
Okay.

Ruy
Uh, just one last thing. I would like you to I mean uh have an estimate of uh how much time this will take you to do? Uh Um I think by tomorrow I can tell.

Speaker 2
Um I think like tomorrow I can tell.

Ruy
Yeah, after the

Speaker 2
Yeah after the

Ruy
So let's do let's do something este once once you a la scoptask here

Speaker 2
Yeah, in the refinement.

Ruy
Mr. Name for Task Cost Yeah, I mean this is a new system or a new thing. But um I would like to for us to start using Estimates because we have not done so far. So just tomorrow when you took a look to it and you understand it, fill it up please.

Speaker 2
Okay. Yeah?

Ruy
So tomorrow there would be este

Speaker 2
So tomorrow there will be a refinement or there wouldn't be

Ruy
I need to change the time, uh Okay, I'll tell I'll text you or if we will have a refinement maybe I'll tell they uh they are no I I'm gonna send uh right now uh a message to the the Discord

Speaker 2
Okay, I'll tell I'll text you or if we will have a refinement maybe I'll tell they uh they are

Ruy
uh to see when I mean probably during the office hours. Because uh yeah it's the Well yeah, I'll send I'll send a message right now. Uh but it it will probably be during the office hours Well okay. So take care and uh we'll talk tomorrow. Okay, see you right.

Speaker 2
Okay, see you, Ryan, bye-bye.

Ruy
Bye bye.
