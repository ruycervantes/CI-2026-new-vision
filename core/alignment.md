# Leadership Alignment: Q1 2026 Direction

> **For:** Oseas, Leo, Mike, Nelson
> **From:** Ruy
> **Purpose:** Commit to the direction so we can execute
> **See also:** [vision.md](vision.md) for platform vision, [vision-behavior-change.md](vision-behavior-change.md) for LD product spec, [roadmap.md](roadmap.md) for engineering roadmap

## The Ask

Read this document and the platform vision. Come ready to say:

**"Yes, this is the direction. Let's go."**

---

## The Bet (Summary)

We are building **one platform with two design spaces** — Leadership Development and Team Effectiveness — sharing a common AI Coach foundation.

### What's Hard to Replicate
- The complete behavior change methodology (grounded in research)
- The system that orchestrates the entire cycle (goals → habits → adjustment → evolution)
- The integrations that create stickiness (reach users where they are)
- The structured memory of the user's change trajectory

### Jan 28 Decisions (Oseas, Nelson, Mike, Ruy)

1. **AI Coach is the shared technology investment** — build this first, it unlocks both LD and HPT
2. **Validate both markets in parallel** — see which has customer pull
3. **HPT validation uses current product** — Nelson leads with slides and visual prototypes
4. **Impact visibility in lockstep** — coaching quality and reporting quality must advance together
5. **Commercial validation required** — Thierry + Fernando Fascioli review all product direction
6. **Stoic is a separate spin-off** — commercial relationship with Axialent unresolved

**Full vision:** [vision.md](vision.md) — covers why we exist, the two design spaces, strategic filter, and what's shared

## This Is Not a Blind Bet

We're not asking you to trust intuition. We're committing to validate before we go deep.

### The Core Assumptions We're Testing

| Assumption | The Question | How We Validate |
|------------|--------------|-----------------|
| **The theory works for us** | Can we translate behavior change research into a product that actually helps people persist? | Build it, test with real users, measure engagement and outcomes |
| **"Owning the behavior change cycle" resonates** | Is this value prop appealing? Does it differentiate us in customer conversations? | Leo runs sales conversations with this positioning |
| **Coaching + daily follow-up integration makes sense** | Do people understand why these need to be connected? Is it intuitive? | User testing, customer feedback |
| **We can build something differentiated AND attractive** | Is what we're building both hard to replicate AND compelling to buy? | Competitive analysis + customer feedback |
| **No cheap substitutes exist** | Are there $10/month apps or free tools that do 80% of what we do? | Market research, competitive analysis |

### Validation Activities

| Activity | Purpose | Owner | Status |
|----------|---------|-------|--------|
| **Competitive Analysis** | Are we differentiated or 80/20 replaceable? | Ruy | In progress |
| **Customer Conversations** | Does the value prop land? What opens doors? | Leo | Q1 |
| **User Pilot** | Does the product actually help? Do people stick with it? | Ruy + Leo | Q1 |
| **Methodology Review** | Is our approach grounded? Does Horacio validate? | Ruy + Horacio | This week |
| **HPT Market Validation** | Does the team effectiveness offering resonate? | Nelson | Q1 |

### What Would Make Us Pivot?

- If customers don't care about "behavior change cycle" → find what they do care about
- If coaching + daily follow-up feels disconnected → rethink the integration
- If competitive analysis shows we're easily replaceable → double down on what's hard to copy
- If LD has no pull but HPT does (or vice versa) → focus resources on the path with traction

**The commitment is to finding product-market fit, not to these specific features.**

## Q1 Strategy: Validate + Build

We run two tracks in parallel:

| Track | Owner | What Happens |
|-------|-------|--------------|
| **Validate** | Leo + Nelson | Run customer conversations for LD and HPT. Test if direction resonates. |
| **Build** | Mike + Shamil | Ship MS Teams notifications + Coach Multi-Session. Create something to show. |

---

## Q1 Scope

### What We're Building

| Feature | Owner | Status | Why It Matters |
|---------|-------|--------|----------------|
| MS Teams Notifications | Mike | In progress | Reach users where they are. Foundation for Daily Companion. |
| Daily Companion Cyclic Flow | Shamil | Ready to build | Loop instead of end. Users can continue, modify, or escalate to Coach. |
| Coach Multi-Session | Shamil + Ruy | Needs Horacio | Coaching with memory. Tracks goals, progress, what's urgent vs planned. |
| Voice OR Bidirectional Chatbot | TBD | Validate with Leo | Choose one based on customer pull. |

### What's NOT in Q1
- GPS Dashboard (needs goal storage foundation first)
- Full context integrations (calendar, email)
- HPT engineering (validation uses current product)
- Peer accountability features

---

## Your Role

| Person | What We Need From You |
|--------|----------------------|
| **Oseas** | Strategic alignment. Board communication. Lockstep validation on visibility. |
| **Leo** | Run LD validation conversations. Decide Voice vs Bidirectional. Track which features shift sales conversations. |
| **Nelson** | HPT market validation. Impact/visibility design. Thierry coordination. |
| **Mike** | Ship Teams notifications. Support Shamil on multi-session architecture. Flag blockers early. |

---

## Key Risks (Acknowledged)

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Users don't engage with goal-setting conversation | Make it shorter, test with real users, iterate |
| MS Teams blocked by client IT | Fallback channels (email, web) |
| We build features that don't move PMF | Leo validates before we build the next thing |
| Methodology not clear enough | Horacio meeting this week; start with "good enough" and refine |
| Both paths demand resources | Shared foundation first; customer pull determines depth |

---

## The Question

> Are we aligned on this direction?
>
> If yes, we start executing. Leo and Nelson validate, Mike and Shamil build.
>
> If concerns, let's surface them now — not after we've started building.
