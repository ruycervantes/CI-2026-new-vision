# Leadership Alignment: Q1 2026 Direction

> **For:** Oseas, Leo, Mike
> **From:** Ruy
> **Purpose:** Commit to the direction so we can execute
> **See also:** [vision.md](vision.md) for methodology, [roadmap.md](roadmap.md) for features

## The Ask

Read this document and the full vision. Come ready to say:

**"Yes, this is the direction. Let's go."**

We've discussed this. The vision reflects your feedback. Now we need to commit so we can execute.

---

## The Bet (Summary)

We are going to **own the behavior change cycle** — not just offer a coaching chatbot.

If we stay as "a chatbot," we compete with everyone. Microsoft Copilot Studio already has one-click coach templates. Anyone with GPT can build a coaching bot.

**What's hard to replicate:**
- The complete behavior change methodology (grounded in research)
- The system that orchestrates the entire cycle (goals → habits → adjustment → evolution)
- The integrations that create stickiness (reach users where they are)
- The structured memory of the user's change trajectory

**Full vision:** [vision.md](vision.md) (read sections 1-4 for the core argument)

## This Is Not a Blind Bet

We're not asking you to trust intuition. We're committing to validate before we go deep.

### The Core Assumptions We're Testing

The research is clear: people struggle to change on their own. Our bet is that we can build something that actually helps. But before we invest heavily, we need to validate:

| Assumption | The Question | How We Validate |
|------------|--------------|-----------------|
| **The theory works for us** | Can we translate behavior change research into a product that actually helps people persist? | Build it, test with real users, measure engagement and outcomes |
| **"Owning the behavior change cycle" resonates** | Is this value prop appealing? Does it differentiate us in customer conversations? | Leo runs sales conversations with this positioning |
| **Coaching + daily follow-up integration makes sense** | Do people understand why these need to be connected? Is it intuitive? | User testing, customer feedback |
| **"Application coaching" is sellable** | Can we position learning-through-practice as differentiated and valuable? | Customer reactions, pipeline movement |
| **We can build something differentiated AND attractive** | Is what we're building both hard to replicate AND compelling to buy? | Competitive analysis + customer feedback |
| **No cheap substitutes exist** | Are there $10/month apps or free tools that do 80% of what we do? | Market research, competitive analysis |
| **Customers won't just build their own** | Will clients look at Copilot Studio or ChatGPT agent builder and say "we can do this ourselves"? Even if our product is deeper, does it *look* different enough? | Customer conversations, demo reactions |

### Validation Activities

| Activity | Purpose | Owner | Status |
|----------|---------|-------|--------|
| **Competitive Analysis** | Are we differentiated or 80/20 replaceable? | Ruy | In progress |
| **Customer Conversations** | Does the value prop land? What opens doors? | Leo | Q1 |
| **User Pilot** | Does the product actually help? Do people stick with it? | Ruy + Leo | Q1 |
| **Methodology Review** | Is our approach grounded? Does Horacio validate? | Ruy + Horacio | This week |

### What Would Make Us Pivot?

We're not married to the plan. If validation shows something different, we adapt:

- If customers don't care about "behavior change cycle" → find what they do care about
- If coaching + daily follow-up feels disconnected → rethink the integration
- If competitive analysis shows we're easily replaceable → double down on what's hard to copy
- If users don't engage → simplify or change the approach

**The commitment is to finding product-market fit, not to these specific features.**

## Q1 Strategy: Validate + Build

We run two tracks in parallel:

| Track | Owner | What Happens |
|-------|-------|--------------|
| **Validate** | Leo | Run customer conversations. Test if this direction resonates. Decide Voice vs Bidirectional Chatbot. |
| **Build** | Mike + Shamil | Ship MS Teams notifications + Coach Multi-Session. Create something to show. |

**Why both tracks?**
- We can't wait to validate before building (3-month runway)
- We can't build blind (risk building the wrong thing)
- Leo's validation informs what we prioritize next

---

## Q1 Scope

### What We're Building

| Feature | Owner | Status | Why It Matters |
|---------|-------|--------|----------------|
| MS Teams Notifications | Mike | In progress | Reach users where they are. Foundation for Daily Companion. |
| Daily Companion Cyclic Flow | Shamil | Ready to build | Loop instead of end. Users can continue, modify, or escalate to Coach. |
| Coach Multi-Session | Shamil + Ruy | Needs Horacio | Coaching with memory. Tracks goals, progress, what's urgent vs planned. |
| Voice OR Bidirectional Chatbot | TBD | Validate with Leo | Choose one based on customer pull. |

### Q1 Validation Experiment

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Users** | Mix of friendly clients + Leo's pipeline |
| **Owner** | Ruy + Leo |
| **Duration** | 2-3 weeks |
| **Goal** | Validate utility and approach (not behavior change outcomes yet) |

**What we're testing:**
- Multi-session Coach feels like a coach who knows you
- Cyclic Daily Companion keeps people engaged
- When users struggle, they feel supported (not guilty)
- Users see how daily actions connect to what they want

**Sales signal:** Leo tracks conversations that shift from "nice chatbot" to "this is different"

### What's NOT in Q1

- GPS Dashboard (needs goal storage foundation first)
- Full context integrations (calendar, email)
- Fluid mode transitions (V1 is explicit)
- Peer accountability features

## Beyond Q1: The Trajectory

| Phase | Focus | Key Features |
|-------|-------|--------------|
| **Q1 2026** | Prove coaching works | Multi-session Coach, Cyclic Daily Companion, Teams notifications |
| **Q2 2026** | Daily practice + feedback | GPS Dashboard, Transcript analysis, Before/After touchpoints |
| **H2 2026** | Full experience | Real-time feedback, Deep integrations, Peer features |

**Full roadmap:** [roadmap.md](roadmap.md)

---

## Your Role

| Person | What We Need From You |
|--------|----------------------|
| **Oseas** | Strategic alignment. "This is the right bet, go execute." Board communication if needed. |
| **Leo** | Run validation conversations. Decide Voice vs Bidirectional. Track which features shift sales conversations. |
| **Mike** | Ship Teams notifications. Support Shamil on multi-session architecture. Flag blockers early. |

---

## Key Risks (Acknowledged)

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Users don't engage with goal-setting conversation | Make it shorter, test with real users, iterate |
| MS Teams blocked by client IT | Fallback channels (email, web) |
| We build features that don't move PMF | Leo validates before we build the next thing |
| Methodology not clear enough | Horacio meeting this week; start with "good enough" and refine |

---

## Decision Needed

**Voice vs Bidirectional Chatbot** — Leo validates with customers, we decide by end of Q1.

---

## Next Steps

1. **Read the full vision:** [vision.md](vision.md)
2. **Review the roadmap:** [roadmap.md](roadmap.md)
3. **Come to alignment meeting ready to commit**

---

## The Question

> Are we aligned on this direction?
>
> If yes, we start executing. Leo validates, Mike and Shamil build.
>
> If concerns, let's surface them now — not after we've started building.
