## Key Reflections & Context *(reference, not tasks)*

### Strategic Context (from Oseas)
- **3-month runway** to prove Stoic works
- If it doesn't work → potential pivot to Axialent digitalization
- Focus 100% on Stoic roadmap for now

### Positioning Insight (from Mike)
> "Si nos quedamos como 'tenemos un chatbot de coaching', competimos con todos. Si nos posicionamos como 'somos dueños del ciclo de cambio de comportamiento', es otra conversación."

### Oseas's Concern: User Willingness
- People don't naturally persist with self-development
- Need to anchor to things people actually care about (promotions, avoiding problems)
- Make it genuinely useful for work, not just "be a better person"

### Stickiness Insight
> "Si esto se vuelve tu Pepe Grillo, no de la chamba sino de todo tu día, pues ahí está muy sticky."

### Product Positioning Insights (Jan 15 Handwritten)
- **"Personal Trainer for work"** - not just accountability, but helping you do what you NEED to do
- **Skills architecture** - Thinking Partner should have specialized skills it can suggest contextually
- **Broader than work** - also help with personal change

### Self-Reflection (from Handwritten Notes)
- **"Yo soy un cuello de botella"** - blocking things by not shipping
- **"Hacemos features y quedan huérfanos"** - features orphaned after building
- **"Sprints ya funcionan, pero PMF es desastre"** - need PMF validation process
- **"Lo necesita un SISTEMA"** - need systems, not just tasks
- **"Ship with confidence"** - can't ship without process

### PMF Cycle Insight
```
Visión de Producto → Validación PMF → Aprendizaje PMF → SPRINT DE DESARROLLO
                                              ↑_________________________|
```

### Horacio Call Insights (Jan 16, 2026)

**Ontology for coaching memory system:**
- Personas → Metas → Comportamiento → Ejemplos
- Key question: **"¿Qué es lo más valioso de recordar?"**

**Coaching process notes:**
- Group coaching (colectivas) vs individual instances
- A/B test idea: detailed notes vs simple tracking
- "Social Setup" / motivación social as feature concept
- **Core insight:** "Necesito poder dar algo en memoria" - system must surface relevant history

### Coaching Insights (Jan 19, 2026 - Handwritten)

**Coaching structure:**
- Coaching typically runs 4-6 specific sessions focused on one thing
- Then maintenance phase follows

**AI vs Human Coaching - Key Distinction:**
- "Las sesiones con Horacio son muy profundas. No sé si le daría eso a un AI."
- **BUT the opportunity:** "Lo chido del AI es que podemos tener sesiones súper tácticas"
- AI can have super tactical sessions focused on very specific things
- Help people in day-to-day workflow - dedicate a coaching conversation to something that otherwise wouldn't have gotten dedicated attention
- Things that would have been very difficult to address otherwise

**Skills-based architecture insight:**
- "Lo podemos implementar en skills"
- See "With Mike" section for full architecture discussion

### Q1 OKRs (Jan 20 - Leo Session)

**Objective 1: Feature Development** - 4 features:
1. Teams integration
2. New coaching version (complete sessions)
3. Voice/STT
4. **Sprint Automation** (environment + prompt customization)

**Objective 2: Product Decision + PMF** - validated roadmap + weekly PMF review (Thu/Fri)

**Objective 3: Team Performance** - processes + release lifecycle

### HPT vs Behavior Change

- Behavior Change: well-defined
- High Performance Team: needs exploration (Mural, notes)
- Explore in parallel to make data-based decision

## Sprint Planning Outcomes (Jan 15, 2026) *(reference, not tasks)*

### Ruy's Sprint Tasks

- **Evaluate Linear vs GitHub Projects** for development tracking
  - Problems with Asana: no epics, testing/dev boards split, no capacity metrics, can't track product/client per issue
  - Linear: modern, great MCP/Claude Code integration, designed for dev
  - GitHub: free, integrated, has Kanban/roadmap/epics, CI/CD automation
  - Action: Write comparison, share via email, discuss in office hours
  - **Prototype plan:** Test Linear MCP integration - try importing vision and roadmap docs

- **Document testing/shipping process** - IN PROGRESS
  - See details: `sprint-methodology-fix.md` → "Testing & Shipping Process" section
  - **Open questions to resolve:**
    - Who notifies sales team when features ready for demo?
    - Can deployment script enforce 3-day demo notice?

- **Add detail to Leo's testing task** (in Asana)
  - Explain how to test Leadership Growth Partner in testing version
  - Give access to testing.stoicq.com
  - See transcript: `calls/Sprint Planning 15 jan 2026.txt`

### Blockers

| Blocker | Owner | Resolution |
|---------|-------|------------|
| No client lifecycle visibility | Team | Document archival process |
| Oseas's coaching vision | Ruy | Requires new version (Q1 roadmap) |

## Product Strategy & Process Definition (This Sprint)

*See detailed discussion: `pmf-design-sprint-planning.md`*

### 1. Define PMF segments + hypotheses (with Leo, ~1 hour)
- [ ] Which 1-2 customer segments for Q1?
- [ ] What's the hypothesis per segment?
- [ ] Who do we have access to? (Leo: clients, prospects, friends)
- [ ] Who are potential users beyond customers?

### 2. Design the design sprint (Ruy, before sprint starts)
- [ ] Choose format: remote accelerated (3-day) vs hybrid with research
- [ ] Which Q1 features in scope?
- [ ] Schedule: this sprint or next?
- [ ] Participant list (Leo, Ruy, who else?)

### 3. PMF process doc (1-pager, create once)
- [ ] Simple template: Segment → Hypothesis → Test → Learn → Iterate
- [ ] Living doc, updated after each validation cycle

### 4. User research (input to design sprint)
- [ ] Interview people who manage teams
- [ ] Potential: Peppe (cousin-in-law) - insight on managing people
- [ ] What would they find useful?

### 5. Customer validation (during/after design sprint)
- [ ] Would they buy "application coaching" sessions?
- [ ] Voice vs Bidirectional Teams chatbot - which first?
- [ ] Does the vision resonate vs competitors?

---

## Operations Requests (Nelson/Axialent)

*Flag these for roadmap discussion - potential Q2+ items*

### Thinkific SSO Integration
- [ ] **Thinkific as SSO provider** (feasible, needs roadmap discussion)
  - Access chatbot from student dashboard (not from lesson)
  - CI shows sidebar menu with coaches
  - "Home" link redirects back to Thinkific
  - *Context:* Makes chatbots an element, not a learning activity

### Chatbot Creation Interface
- [ ] **Self-service chatbot creation for Axialent** (backlog)
  - Nelson wants autonomy to create chatbots
  - Ruy has scripts that could be automated
  - Even basic/unpolished would help

### Nelson's Role
- [ ] **Clarify Nelson's new role** - understand implications for collaboration/requests
