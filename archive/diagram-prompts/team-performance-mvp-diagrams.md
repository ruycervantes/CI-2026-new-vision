# Team Performance MVP — Diagram Prompts

Prompts for the hybrid team effectiveness positioning document. All use **whiteboard/sketch aesthetic** — hand-drawn look, collaborative feel, as if drawn during a strategy session.

Generated with image AI (Gemini, Nanobanana, or similar).

## 1. Two Tracks, One Team

**Purpose:** Shows the Personal Track (AI) and Team Track (Human) running in parallel with connection points. This is the core visual for understanding the hybrid model.

**For document section:** How It Works / The Offer

**Prompt:**
```
Create a whiteboard-style diagram showing two parallel tracks for team development, drawn with hand-sketched lines and a collaborative feel.

At the top, draw a banner or header labeled "90-DAY TEAM EFFECTIVENESS" with subtitle "(Two Tracks, One Team)"

Below, draw two horizontal lanes running left to right, stacked vertically:

TOP LANE - Draw with a blue tint or border:
Label on left: "TEAM TRACK"
Subtitle: "(Human Consultant)"
Inside the lane, show 4 markers from left to right:
• "Offsite" (icon: people at table)
• "Check-in" (icon: video call)
• "Check-in" (icon: video call)
• "Review" (icon: clipboard)
Below lane: "Every ~2 weeks"

BOTTOM LANE - Draw with a green tint or border:
Label on left: "PERSONAL TRACK"
Subtitle: "(AI Coach)"
Inside the lane, show continuous dotted line with weekly markers:
• Multiple small nodes labeled "Session" (icon: chat bubble)
Below lane: "Weekly + available anytime"

ON THE LEFT SIDE (feeding into both tracks):
Draw a box labeled "ASSESSMENTS"
Two items inside:
• "Team Assessment" (arrow pointing to top lane)
• "CB Assessment" (arrow pointing to bottom lane)
Annotation: "Surfaces the invisible"

BETWEEN THE TWO LANES, show connection points:
• Dotted line from bottom lane up with label: "Patterns surface"
• Dotted line from top lane down with label: "Context shared"
• In the middle, a small box: "ACCOUNTABILITY" with note: "Commitment visible, content private"

At the very bottom: "AI enables personalized development for everyone. Human consultant integrates the system."

Style: Hand-drawn whiteboard sketch. Blue tones for team track, green tones for personal track. Arrows should be curved and organic. White background with subtle texture. Professional but informal, like drawn during a strategy meeting.
```

**Key Elements Checklist:**
- [ ] Header with "90-DAY TEAM EFFECTIVENESS"
- [ ] Two parallel lanes clearly labeled (Team Track, Personal Track)
- [ ] Assessments feeding into both tracks on the left
- [ ] Touchpoint markers showing frequency difference
- [ ] Connection points between tracks (patterns surface, context shared)
- [ ] Accountability box in the middle
- [ ] Whiteboard aesthetic

## 2. The 90-Day Cycle

**Purpose:** Shows the four phases across time with both tracks visible. This is the timeline view of what actually happens.

**For document section:** How It Works

**Prompt:**
```
Create a whiteboard-style journey map showing a 90-day team effectiveness cycle. Hand-drawn, horizontal flow.

TITLE at top: "THE 90-DAY CYCLE"

Draw a horizontal timeline from left to right with four phases marked:

PHASE 1 - "ASSESS" (Week 1-2):
Draw a rectangle/zone containing:
• Icon: clipboard with checkmarks
• "Team Assessment" - arrow pointing up
• "CB Assessment (each person)" - arrow pointing down
• Annotation below: "Surface the gaps"

PHASE 2 - "FOUNDATION" (Week 2-4):
Draw a rectangle/zone containing:
• Icon: people around table
• "Virtual Offsite" (consultant-led)
• "Purpose, agreements, desired state"
• Below: "AI Coach Onboarding"
• Annotation: "Build trust first"

PHASE 3 - "DEVELOPMENT" (Week 4-12):
This is the largest zone. Show TWO PARALLEL TRACKS:
• Top track (blue): "Team Track" with check-in markers every 2 weeks
• Bottom track (green): "Personal Track" with weekly session markers
• Between them: small icons showing materials/learning
• Label in middle: "Inverted classroom: Learn async, practice sync"
• Annotation: "Both levels, simultaneously"

PHASE 4 - "REVIEW" (Week 12):
Draw a rectangle/zone containing:
• Icon: chart/graph going up
• "Re-assess progress"
• "Identify next cycle focus"
• Curved arrow looping back to Phase 1
• Annotation: "Cycle repeats"

At the bottom, draw a dotted arc connecting Phase 4 back to Phase 1, labeled: "Real change takes ~90 days. Then iterate."

Style: Hand-drawn whiteboard sketch. Timeline should feel like a road or path. Blue for team elements, green for personal elements. White background with subtle texture. Include small icons at each phase. Professional but informal.
```

**Key Elements Checklist:**
- [ ] Title "THE 90-DAY CYCLE"
- [ ] Four phases clearly marked with week numbers
- [ ] Phase 3 (Development) is largest, shows both tracks
- [ ] "Inverted classroom" label visible
- [ ] Loop arrow from Phase 4 back to Phase 1
- [ ] "Real change takes ~90 days" annotation
- [ ] Whiteboard aesthetic

**Output filename:** `team-perf-02-90-day-cycle.png`

## 3. The Unlock

**Purpose:** Shows the before/after comparison — what changes when you add AI coaching. Simple and punchy.

**For document section:** Why AI Changes the Equation

**Prompt:**
```
Create a whiteboard-style before/after comparison diagram. Hand-drawn, two panels side by side.

TITLE at top: "WHY AI CHANGES THE EQUATION"

LEFT PANEL - labeled "BEFORE" with a red/orange X or muted tone:
Subtitle: "(Consultant Only)"
Draw a simple team diagram with 6-8 stick figures in a group:
• 1-2 figures highlighted/circled with label: "Gets coaching"
• The rest grayed out with label: "Gets workshops"
• Small annotation: "Budget limits who develops"
• Below: "Leader grows. Team hopes it sticks."

RIGHT PANEL - labeled "NOW" with a green checkmark or bright tone:
Subtitle: "(Hybrid Model)"
Draw the same team diagram with 6-8 stick figures:
• ALL figures highlighted/circled
• Each has a small AI icon or chat bubble next to them
• Label: "Everyone gets an AI coach"
• Small annotation: "Personalized development at scale"
• Below: "Whole team develops together."

Between the two panels, draw a large arrow pointing from left to right.

At the bottom: "Same quality of attention that was reserved for executives — now available to everyone."

Style: Hand-drawn whiteboard sketch. Left panel should feel limited/constrained (muted colors). Right panel should feel expansive/possible (brighter colors, green). Simple stick figures, not detailed. White background. The contrast should be immediately visible.
```

**Key Elements Checklist:**
- [ ] Title "WHY AI CHANGES THE EQUATION"
- [ ] Two panels clearly labeled BEFORE / NOW
- [ ] Left panel shows 1-2 people getting coaching, rest grayed
- [ ] Right panel shows everyone with AI coach icon
- [ ] Arrow between panels
- [ ] Contrast in color/energy between panels
- [ ] Bottom tagline about access
- [ ] Whiteboard aesthetic

**Output filename:** `team-perf-03-the-unlock.png`

## Usage Notes

1. **Generate one at a time** — Review each output before moving to the next
2. **Iterate on prompts** — If AI misses elements, add more specific instructions
3. **Consistent style** — All should feel like they came from the same whiteboard session
4. **Export as PNG** — For embedding in documents and presentations
