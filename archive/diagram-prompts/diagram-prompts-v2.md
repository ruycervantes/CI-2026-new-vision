# Diagram Prompts v2 - Conscious Insights Vision

Prompts for the new vision document diagrams. All use **whiteboard/sketch aesthetic** — hand-drawn look, collaborative feel, as if drawn during a strategy session.

Generated with image AI (Gemini, Nanobanana, or similar).

## 1. Goal Hierarchy

**Purpose:** Shows the three-level goal structure that connects daily actions to what users actually want. Central concept in the methodology.

**For document section:** §4 The Goal Hierarchy

**Prompt:**
```
Create a whiteboard-style diagram showing a three-level goal hierarchy, drawn with hand-sketched lines and a collaborative feel.

Draw three horizontal rounded rectangles stacked vertically, connected by downward arrows:

TOP BOX - Large, emphasized with a target icon:
Label: "DESTINATION GOAL"
Subtitle in smaller text: "(What you actually want)"
Example in quotes: "Get promoted to team lead"
Small annotation to the side: "→ Hooks engagement"

MIDDLE BOX - Medium size, with a person/mindset icon:
Label: "MANAGEMENT GOAL"
Subtitle: "(Who you need to become)"
Example in quotes: "Be a leader who listens, empowers, and decides"
Small annotation: "→ Drives persistence"

BOTTOM BOX - Slightly smaller, with a checkmark or daily calendar icon:
Label: "TRACKING GOAL"
Subtitle: "(What you practice daily)"
Example in quotes: "Ask one question before responding in meetings"
Small annotation: "→ Measurable action"

Between boxes, draw curved arrows with labels:
- Top to Middle arrow: "requires becoming"
- Middle to Bottom arrow: "practiced through"

Add a dotted line arcing from bottom back up to top, labeled: "each action moves you closer"

At the bottom, small text: "All three must be connected and visible to the user."

Style: Hand-drawn whiteboard sketch with blue and black marker look. Slightly imperfect lines. Green highlight or glow on the destination goal at top. White background with subtle paper texture. Include small icons next to each level (target, brain/person, checkmark). Professional but informal, like drawn during a strategy meeting.
```

**Key Elements Checklist:**
- [ ] Three distinct levels clearly labeled
- [ ] Destination → Management → Tracking flow visible
- [ ] Juan's example at each level (team lead, leader who listens, ask one question)
- [ ] Arrows showing the connections
- [ ] Dotted "feedback" line from bottom to top
- [ ] Icons for each level
- [ ] Whiteboard aesthetic

**Output filename:** `01-goal-hierarchy.png`

## 2. One System, Two Modes

**Purpose:** Shows STOIC as one unified system with Coach and Daily Companion as two complementary aspects, not separate products.

**For document section:** §3 One System, Two Modes

**Prompt:**
```
Create a whiteboard-style diagram showing one integrated system with two modes, drawn with hand-sketched lines.

At the top, draw a banner or header rectangle labeled "STOIC" with subtitle "(One Integrated System)"

Below the header, draw a large rounded container that holds two side-by-side boxes:

LEFT BOX - Draw with a blue tint or border:
Label: "COACH"
Subtitle: "(Deep Conversations)"
Bullet points inside:
• Set intrinsic goals
• Identify the gap
• Process setbacks
• Evolve the plan
Small icon in corner: thought bubble or two people talking

RIGHT BOX - Draw with a green tint or border:
Label: "DAILY COMPANION"
Subtitle: "(Daily Practice)"
Bullet points inside:
• Reminders & check-ins
• Progress tracking (GPS)
• Surface experiences
• Celebrate wins
Small icon in corner: mobile phone or calendar

Between the two boxes, draw two curved arrows forming a cycle:
- Arrow from Coach to Daily Companion (pointing right), labeled: "Concrete actions to practice"
- Arrow from Daily Companion to Coach (pointing left), labeled: "Patterns & setbacks surface"

Below the main container, add a small section with the header "When Each Activates:"
Three small annotations:
- "Starting out → Coach"
- "Day to day → Daily Companion"
- "Hit a setback → Coach"

At the very bottom: "Same system. Two aspects. One user journey."

Style: Hand-drawn whiteboard sketch. The outer container should feel unified, showing these are NOT separate products. Blue tones for Coach, green tones for Daily Companion. Arrows should be curved and organic. White background with subtle texture. Professional but informal.
```

**Key Elements Checklist:**
- [ ] STOIC header clearly labels this as ONE system
- [ ] Two boxes side by side within shared container
- [ ] Coach (blue) and Daily Companion (green) with bullet points
- [ ] Bidirectional arrows showing the cycle
- [ ] "When Each Activates" section at bottom
- [ ] Feels unified, not like two separate things
- [ ] Whiteboard aesthetic

**Output filename:** `02-one-system-two-modes.png`

## 3. GPS Dashboard (Phone Mockup)

**Purpose:** Makes the "GPS" concept tangible by showing what Juan actually sees — progress toward his destination goal with sub-goals and trajectory.

**For document section:** §8 The Goals Dashboard (GPS)

**Prompt:**
```
Create a whiteboard-style mockup of a mobile app dashboard, drawn as if sketching a wireframe during a meeting.

Draw a smartphone frame (rounded rectangle with slightly thicker borders) containing:

HEADER AREA at top of phone screen:
- Target icon (hand-drawn) with text: "Team Lead Promotion"
- Below it, a large progress bar labeled "Overall Progress" showing approximately 70% filled
- The 70% portion should be colored (green or blue)

MAIN CONTENT - Three goal cards stacked vertically:

CARD 1:
- Label: "Being seen as collaborative"
- Progress bar: ~85% filled (green, almost complete)
- Small text below: "24 Learner questions this month"
- Small checkmark or star icon

CARD 2:
- Label: "Managing conflict well"
- Progress bar: ~45% filled (yellow/orange)
- Small text: "Current focus" with an arrow or star pointing to it
- This card slightly emphasized (maybe subtle border)

CARD 3:
- Label: "Building team trust"
- Progress bar: ~30% filled (light gray, not started much)
- Small text: "Up next"

FOOTER AREA at bottom of phone screen:
- Small section labeled "📈 Your Trajectory"
- A tiny timeline sketch showing three points:
  - Left: "Nov - Started"
  - Middle: "Dec - Breakthrough" (small star)
  - Right: "Now" (with upward arrow)

Outside the phone frame, add a small annotation: "Juan sees how each daily action moves him toward team lead"

Style: Hand-drawn whiteboard sketch of a phone wireframe. Should feel like a UX sketch drawn during brainstorming, not a polished mockup. Blue marker for the phone frame, green for progress, black for text. Include small doodles like checkmarks and stars. White background.
```

**Key Elements Checklist:**
- [ ] Phone/mobile frame clearly visible
- [ ] "Team Lead Promotion" as the destination goal at top
- [ ] Overall progress bar (70%)
- [ ] Three sub-goal cards with individual progress
- [ ] Current focus highlighted
- [ ] Trajectory section showing journey over time
- [ ] Feels like a wireframe sketch, not polished UI
- [ ] Whiteboard aesthetic

## 4. Juan's Journey (Annotated Map)

**Purpose:** Shows Juan's complete journey from assessment to achieving his goal, with the critical setback/adjustment loop visible. This is the centerpiece visual for the methodology.

**For document section:** §7 Juan's Journey

**Prompt:**
```
Create a whiteboard-style annotated journey map showing a professional's transformation over several months. Hand-drawn, horizontal flow with a key loop visible.

MAIN TIMELINE - Draw a horizontal path from left to right with waypoints:

LEFT SIDE (Start):
- Small icon of Juan looking uncertain/stressed
- Label: "Juan - November"
- Annotation below: "Knower pattern identified"

WAYPOINT 1 - Circle or node on the path:
- Label above: "Assessment + Debrief"
- Small icon: clipboard or assessment form
- Brief annotation: "Understands his patterns"

WAYPOINT 2 - Circle or node:
- Label above: "Goal Conversation"
- Small icon: two people talking (Coach)
- Annotation: "Sets intrinsic goals"
- Below, show the three goals in small text:
  • "Destination: Team Lead"
  • "Management: Leader who listens"
  • "Tracking: Ask before responding"

WAYPOINT 3 - Circle or node:
- Label above: "Habit Created"
- Small icon: lightbulb or "If→Then"
- Annotation: "If I want to prove I'm right → Ask a question"

WAYPOINT 4 - Circle or node (this one has a LOOP):
- Label above: "Daily Practice"
- Small icon: calendar with checkmarks
- Annotation: "Daily Companion active"
-
BELOW WAYPOINT 4, draw a DOWNWARD LOOP:
- A path going down from the main timeline
- Label on the descent: "Setback" with an X mark
- Small annotation: "Missed check-ins, stress"
- At the bottom of the loop: "Coach Activates"
- Speech bubble: "What's getting in the way?"
- Path curves back UP to rejoin the main timeline
- Label on the ascent: "Adjust Approach"
- Annotation: "New practice for stressful times"

The loop should clearly show: setback → coach conversation → adaptation → back to practice

WAYPOINT 5 - After the loop rejoins:
- Label above: "Iterate"
- Small icon: circular arrows
- Annotation: "Multiple habits over time"
- Dotted lines suggesting repetition

RIGHT SIDE (Finish):
- Star or trophy icon
- Label: "Team Lead - Months Later"
- Small icon of Juan looking confident, smiling
- Annotation: "Team notices the difference"

BOTTOM OF DIAGRAM:
A dotted line connecting start to finish, labeled: "The trajectory is visible - Juan can see his whole journey"

AT THE TOP:
Title: "JUAN'S JOURNEY: From Knower to Leader"

Style: Hand-drawn whiteboard sketch. The main path should feel like a road or trail. Use blue for the main timeline, orange/red for the setback loop descent, green for the recovery/ascent. Include small character sketches of Juan at start and end showing transformation. Annotations in black. Icons should be simple sketches. White background with subtle texture. The setback loop should be prominent - it's a key part of the methodology, not a failure.
```

**Key Elements Checklist:**
- [ ] Clear horizontal timeline from November to "Months Later"
- [ ] 5 main waypoints with labels and icons
- [ ] Juan's three goals visible at the Goal Conversation waypoint
- [ ] THE SETBACK LOOP is prominent - shows descent, coach activation, and recovery
- [ ] "What's getting in the way?" speech bubble at bottom of loop
- [ ] Juan character at start (stressed) and end (confident)
- [ ] "Team Lead" destination clearly marked as achievement
- [ ] Trajectory annotation at bottom
- [ ] Whiteboard aesthetic, warm and encouraging tone
