## Story Arc

**Trigger:** Juan receives a challenging email questioning his team's performance
**Intervention:** CI sidebar in Outlook helps him think through his response
**Outcome:** He sends a thoughtful reply instead of reacting defensively

## The 3 Panels

### Panel 1: The Trigger
**Scene:** Juan at his desk, looking at his laptop with a frustrated/defensive expression. His body language shows tension — maybe leaning forward, jaw tight.

**On screen:** Outlook inbox showing an email:
- From: "Sandra Chen (VP Operations)"
- Subject: "Re: Q4 Results - Concerned about your team's delivery timeline"
- Preview text: "Juan, I need to understand why the project deadline slipped again..."

**Juan's expression:** Tense, defensive, about to fire back a response.

**Visual cues:** Maybe his hands hovering over keyboard, ready to type an angry reply.

---

### Panel 2: The Intervention (UI Mockup - CENTER)
**Scene:** Detailed Outlook interface mockup showing the email and CI sidebar.

**Left side - Outlook email view:**
- Outlook blue header bar with standard icons
- Email from Sandra visible
- Email body: "Juan, I need to understand why the project deadline slipped again. This is the second time this quarter. The executive team is asking questions and I need answers before Friday's meeting."
- Reply compose area at bottom (maybe showing Juan's cursor blinking, or a crossed-out angry draft)

**Right side - CI Sidebar:**
- Header: "Conscious Insights" with green accent bar (like reference image)
- **💡 Recommended Action:**
  "Before responding, consider: What outcome do you want from this conversation?"
- **❓ Impact:**
  "Sandra may be under pressure too. A defensive response could escalate; a collaborative one could build trust."
- **✏️ Suggested Approach:**
  "Acknowledge her concern first. Then share context about what happened and your plan to address it."

**Style:** Clean UI mockup but with slight sketch/hand-drawn feel to match comic aesthetic. Outlook blues on left, CI green accents on right.

---

### Panel 3: The Outcome
**Scene:** Juan at desk, now calm and composed. Slight smile of relief/satisfaction.

**On screen:** Outlook showing "Your message has been sent" confirmation, or the sent email in his outbox.

**Thought bubble:** "Glad I didn't send that first draft."

**Visual cues:** More relaxed posture, maybe coffee cup in hand, warmer lighting.

**Optional:** Small preview of his actual sent message showing a professional, constructive tone.

Create a 3-panel horizontal comic strip showing a professional named Juan dealing with a difficult work email, with help from an AI coaching assistant.

Panel layout: 3 panels in a single horizontal row.

PANEL 1 (left) - "The Trigger":
Juan sitting at his desk looking at his laptop with a frustrated, defensive expression. On his screen is an Outlook inbox showing an email from "Sandra Chen (VP Operations)" with subject "Re: Q4 Results - Concerned about your team's delivery timeline". Juan looks tense, hands hovering over keyboard, about to react. Style: warm comic illustration.

PANEL 2 (center) - "The Intervention" - UI MOCKUP:
A detailed mockup of Microsoft Outlook interface. Left side shows the email compose window with Sandra's email visible asking about missed deadlines. Right side shows a coaching sidebar labeled "Conscious Insights" with green header bar. The sidebar has three sections:
1. Lightbulb icon "Recommended Action": "What outcome do you want from this conversation?"
2. Question mark icon "Impact": "A collaborative response could build trust."
3. Pencil icon "Suggested Approach": "Acknowledge her concern first, then share your plan."
Style: Clean UI mockup with slight hand-drawn sketch feel. Outlook blue interface, green accents on sidebar.

PANEL 3 (right) - "The Outcome":
Juan at his desk looking calm and relieved with a slight smile. Screen shows "Message sent" confirmation. Thought bubble says "Glad I didn't send that first draft." He looks relaxed, maybe holding coffee. Warmer lighting. Style: warm comic illustration matching panel 1.

Overall style: Cohesive comic strip feel. Panels 1 and 3 are illustrated, panel 2 is a stylized UI mockup. Warm color palette with Outlook blues and green CI accents. The emotional arc should be clear: frustrated → guided → satisfied.
