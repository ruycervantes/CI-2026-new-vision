# Where to Pick Up: Team Effectiveness + Behavior Change Integration

**Created:** 22 Jan 2026
**Status:** Brain dump, needs processing

---

## The Big Idea

Individual coaching and team effectiveness are **not either/or**—they build on each other:

- **Team assessment** shows WHERE the team underperforms (4 quadrants)
- **CB assessment** shows WHAT individual behaviors/mindsets cause that
- **Intervention** happens at individual level (AI coach) but moves the team needle

This is the value prop: diagnosis at team level, intervention at individual level.

## Calls to Process

| `calls/Continuación - explicación proceso coaching -horacio and ruy 22jan2026.txt` | Coaching methodology, how to run good sessions |
| `calls/1-1 Oseas Ruy 22jan2026.txt` | **MVP ideas**, strategic direction, buyer (HR / boss of team lead) |

**After processing:** Find the common threads across all four.

## Emerging Framework

### Entry Point: Dual Assessment
1. Axialent Team Effectiveness Assessment (4 quadrants, Katzenbach-based)
   → Source: `research/sources/team-effectiveness/`
2. CB Assessment (individual)

**Need:** Consultant work to properly connect the two. But the basic logic is: "Team weak in quadrant X" → "Here are the individual CB patterns causing that"

### Opening the Gap
- Design how to surface the gap collectively
- Human coach debrief with the team

### Intervention Tools
1. Human onboarding with coach (collective debrief, build initial context)
2. Each person continues with personal AI coach (modified Thinking Partner)

## Key Insights from Richi

**Two types of "aha moments" in coaching:**

1. **Espoused values vs. values-in-action** — You discover the gap between what you say you believe and how you actually behave

2. **"Ayúdame a ayudarte"** — You discover what you need from others, and learn to ask. This creates a virtuous circle where the team becomes more than the sum of its parts.

**Also from Richi:** Role playing as a technique (extract details from call)

## Critical Dependency

> We need to get the Thinking Partner / "general coach" right first.

Team effectiveness builds ON TOP OF working individual coaching. Don't build the team layer until the foundation works.

---

## Open Questions

1. What's the **MVP**? (Ideas in Oseas call—extract them)
2. Who is the buyer? HR or boss of team lead (Oseas wants this)
3. How do the two assessments map to each other? (Needs consultant, but sketch hypothesis)

## Next Steps (Tomorrow)

1. Process the 4 calls using `/process-call`
2. Write the vision document for team effectiveness offering
3. Define MVP from Oseas call ideas
4. Add tasks to Todoist
