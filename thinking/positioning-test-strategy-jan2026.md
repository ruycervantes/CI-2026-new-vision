# Positioning Test Strategy

**Date:** 26 Jan 2026
**Status:** Decision made, needs execution plan

---

## The Crux

Test **Team Performance** vs **Behavior Change** as the positioning for PMF tests via sales.

---

## The Decision

**Build:** Behavior change foundation (same underlying product work regardless of positioning)

**Test:** Two positionings with real customers
- Position A: Team Performance
- Position B: Behavior Change / Leadership Development

**Let the market tell us** which framing has better traction.

---

## Why This Makes Sense

### Oseas's argument for Team Performance:
- Companies are more inclined to buy "team performance" than "leadership development"
- Larger addressable market: any team can buy team performance; only HR buys leadership development

### Ruy's constraint:
- Can't deeply build two products simultaneously
- Behavior change foundation is needed regardless (even for team effectiveness)
- Don't have someone else who can take the other track

### The resolution:
- The underlying product work is the same
- Positioning is the variable we're testing
- If Team Performance sells, humans (Horacio + Nelson) can deliver early pilots while foundation gets built

---

## Key Insight from Oseas

> "Sell Team Performance, deliver individual coaching."

Individual coaching is the *mechanism*, not the *product identity*.

---

## What's Needed to Execute

### 1. Wrapper MVP for Team Performance positioning
- Team Survey (exists)
- CB Assessment (exists)
- Cross-analysis design (how individual patterns contribute to team issues)
- AI Coach with team context framing
- Human facilitation (Horacio + Nelson)

### 2. Feasibility conversation
- Can Horacio + Nelson deliver team effectiveness pilots?
- Do they have capacity? Are they willing?

### 3. Sales materials for both positionings
- Slides/pitch for Team Performance
- Slides/pitch for Behavior Change
- Same underlying product, different framing

---

## Open Questions

1. Is Horacio + Nelson delivery feasible? (Need to discuss)
2. Who are the test customers for each positioning?
3. What signals would tell us one positioning is winning?

## Next Steps

- [ ] Create wrapper MVP design (how Team Performance offering looks)
- [ ] Talk to Horacio + Nelson about feasibility
- [ ] Discuss with Oseas: confirm this is the plan, align on test structure
