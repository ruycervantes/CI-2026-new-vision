## Visual Style

- **Style:** Informal comic illustration with hand-drawn feel — not stick figures, but not hyper-realistic either
- **Character:** Juan is a mid-30s professional, casual but put-together (button shirt, no tie)
- **Settings:** Modern office environment, desk with computer, meeting rooms
- **Color palette:** Soft, warm colors. System messages in blue/teal. Juan's world in warmer tones.
- **Speech/thought bubbles:** System messages in rounded blue bubbles. Juan's thoughts in cloud-style bubbles.
- **Panel borders:** Slightly hand-drawn, not perfectly straight
- **UI elements:** Stylized but recognizable — Teams chat interface, calendar, phone notifications

## The 6 Panels

### Panel 1: Morning — Calendar Check (8:00 AM)
**Scene:** Juan at his desk, coffee cup in hand, looking at his computer screen. Morning light through window.
**On screen:** Calendar showing "10:00 - Meeting with Pedro (1:1)" highlighted
**System bubble** (floating near calendar, blue): "Tough conversation ahead. Remember your microhabit: pause 3 seconds before responding."
**Juan's expression:** Slightly anxious but nodding, acknowledging the reminder.

### Panel 2: Pre-Meeting Nudge (9:55 AM)
**Scene:** Juan walking in office hallway toward meeting room. His phone buzzes in his hand.
**Phone notification:** Shows Teams icon with message: "Meeting in 5 min. You practiced this. Breathe. 🫁"
**Juan's expression:** Takes a deep breath, small determined smile. He's ready.

### Panel 3: Post-Meeting Check-in (11:00 AM)
**Scene:** Juan back at his desk after the meeting. Teams chat window open on his screen. He looks relieved.
**Teams chat on screen:** System message: "Meeting with Pedro just ended. How did it go?"
**Juan's expression:** Thoughtful, hands on keyboard, about to respond.

### Panel 4: The Conversation (11:02 AM)
**Scene:** Close-up on the Teams chat window (can still see part of Juan's face/hands).
**Chat conversation:**
- **Juan:** "Better than usual. I caught myself about to react and paused."
- **System:** "That's the third time this week 🎯 What's making it easier?"
- **Juan:** "Knowing I'll reflect on it after helps me stay aware."
- **System:** "That's a great insight. I'll note that for your next check-in."

### Panel 5: End of Day — Reflection (5:30 PM)
**Scene:** Juan at his desk, sunset light through window, packing up his bag. Phone shows a gentle notification.
**Phone notification:** "Before you go — 30 seconds to reflect on today?"
**Juan's thought bubble:** "Actually... yeah, let me do that."
**Small inset:** Juan speaking a quick voice note into his phone, or typing briefly.

### Panel 6: The Feeling (5:35 PM)
**Scene:** Juan walking out of the office (or closing his laptop at home), genuine smile on his face.
**Thought bubble:** "It's like having a coach who actually gets my day."
**Visual element:** Subtle warm glow or friendly icon representing the system as a supportive presence — not intrusive, just there.
**Optional text at bottom:** "Conscious Insights — Change that fits your life."
