# Planning Review (Ruy's Personal Work)

Skill for Ruy to manage his own work - weekly review and sprint focus.

**This is NOT team sprint planning.** Team sprint stories and dev planning is a separate process.

## When to Use

- Start of a sprint (define Ruy's focus)
- Weekly review (check progress, adjust)
- When feeling scattered or overwhelmed
- When asking "what should I be working on?"

---

## Sprint File Lifecycle

```
SPRINT START (/planning-review)
→ Create new sprint file from template below
→ Pull relevant items from action-items backlog
→ Define deliverables, right-size, sequence

DURING SPRINT
→ Sprint file = source of truth for "what Ruy is doing"
→ Update status as things complete
→ New items go to action-items (backlog) unless urgent

SPRINT END (/planning-review for next sprint)
→ Review: what completed? what didn't?
→ Incomplete items → back to action-items OR next sprint
→ Archive sprint file to archive/sprints/
→ Create new sprint file
```

---

## The Review Process

### 1. Read Context First
- Check `action-items-ruy-jan2026.md` for backlog
- Check current sprint file if exists
- Read any docs Ruy mentions

### 2. Reflect the Pattern
- What's the current state?
- What's working? What's stuck?
- Use Ruy's own words when possible
- Surface tensions or blockers

### 3. Clarify the Goal
Ask: "What are you trying to achieve this session?"
- Don't assume - the goal might be different each time
- Could be: plan the sprint, review progress, unblock something, organize backlog

### 4. Identify the Key Decision
- What's the one choice that unlocks everything else?
- Example: "This sprint = foundation, next sprint = design sprint"
- Make the decision explicit before listing tasks

### 5. List Deliverables, Then Right-Size
For each deliverable, define:
- **Output:** What does "done" look like?
- **Scope:** What's the right size (not too big, not too small)?
- **Time:** Rough effort (1 hour, 1 afternoon, 1 session)

Use "Wrong Size / Right Size" framing if helpful:
| Deliverable | Wrong Size | Right Size |
|-------------|------------|------------|
| Example | Full analysis | 1-page summary answering one question |

### 6. Discuss Where to Capture
- **Sprint file** - Time-bound work for current sprint
- **Action items** - Ongoing backlog and reference
- **Todoist** - When trusted as source of truth

Ask before creating: "Where should this live?"

### 7. Create/Update Sprint File Together
- Use template below
- Iterate, don't hand over a finished doc
- Ruy provides corrections, assistant updates
- Multiple passes are normal

### 8. Add Sequencing
- What depends on what?
- Week 1 vs Week 2 breakdown
- What's the critical path?

### 9. Note What's In Motion
- What's already started?
- What's waiting on others?
- Who needs to respond?

### 10. End with Clear Next Action
- What's TODAY?
- What's the single most important thing?

## Key Principles

- **Discussion before action** - Talk through structure before creating files
- **Scoping over prioritizing** - Right-size everything rather than cut things
- **Systems over tasks** - Create processes that run themselves
- **Files as source of truth** - Until Todoist is trusted, files come first
- **Reflect, don't prescribe** - Show patterns, let Ruy confirm or correct

---

## Sprint File Template

**Naming:** `sprint-{N}-{YEAR}-{theme}.md` (e.g., `sprint-2-2026-foundation.md`)

```markdown
# Sprint {N} {YEAR} - {Theme}

**Dates:** {Start} - {End}
**Mission:** {One sentence - what does success look like?}

{Context if needed - what comes next, what this enables}

---

## Sequence

```
WEEK 1 ({dates}):
├── {Deliverable} ← {status}
├── {Deliverable}
└── {Deliverable}

WEEK 2 ({dates}):
├── {Deliverable}
├── {Deliverable}
└── {Deliverable}
```

---

## Deliverables

| Deliverable | Scope | Time | Status |
|-------------|-------|------|--------|
| **{Name}** | {Right-sized scope} | {Effort} | {Status} |

---

## Tasks by Deliverable

### 1. {Deliverable Name}

**Output:** {What "done" looks like}

**Tasks:**
- [ ] {Task}
- [ ] {Task}

---

### 2. {Deliverable Name}

**Output:** {What "done" looks like}

**Tasks:**
- [ ] {Task}

---

## Other Sprint Tasks

{Tasks from team sprint planning or carry-overs that aren't main deliverables}

- [ ] {Task}

---

## End of Sprint Checklist

By {end date}:

- [ ] {Deliverable} - {what done looks like}
- [ ] {Deliverable} - {what done looks like}

**{Theme} complete → Ready for {what comes next}**

---

## Reference

- {Link to relevant docs}
```

---

## Start

Begin by reading the current context files, then ask: "What are you trying to achieve in this planning session?"
