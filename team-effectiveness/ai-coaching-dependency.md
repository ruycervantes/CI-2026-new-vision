# AI Coaching Dependency for Team Effectiveness

**Purpose:** Explain to the team why we need AI coaching to work before we can deliver team effectiveness.

## The Structure

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│           TEAM EFFECTIVENESS MVP                    │
├─────────────────────┬───────────────────────────────┤
│   TEAM TRACK        │   PERSONAL TRACK              │
│   (Human consultant)│   (AI Coach) ← WE BUILD THIS  │
├─────────────────────┼───────────────────────────────┤
│ • Assessments       │ • Coaching sessions           │
│ • Offsites          │ • Check-ins                   │
│ • Facilitation      │ • Progress logging            │
└─────────────────────┴───────────────────────────────┘
```

**The AI coach is what scales.** The human consultant can't coach everyone — budget doesn't allow it. AI coaching means every person on the team gets personalized development.

If the AI coach doesn't work → the whole offering collapses.

## What We Need (Minimum)

| Component | What it needs | Status |
|-----------|---------------|--------|
| **Coach Mode** | Memory across sessions, coaching goals tracked, team context | Needs work |
| **Daily Companion** | Simple check-in ("Did you practice X?"), yes/no logging | Close to current, 1-2 sprints to polish |

---

## What We're NOT Blocking On

| Feature | Why it can wait |
|---------|-----------------|
| GPS Dashboard | Human consultant provides progress visibility |
| Goal Hierarchy UI | Coach tracks goals internally |
| Sophisticated Adjust stage | Consultant catches patterns, directs to coach |

**The team structure provides what the product would otherwise need to build.**

## Discussion Questions

1. Does this minimum feel right for a first team effectiveness pilot?
2. What's missing that would block us?
3. How does team context get into the AI coach?
