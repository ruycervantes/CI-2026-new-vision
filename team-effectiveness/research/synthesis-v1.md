## 1. Design Principles

Consolidated from all four calls. These are the "how it should work" statements.

### The Gap is the Raw Material
*Sources: Richi, Horacio*

> "La brecha es la materia prima para trabajar" — Richi

Coaching works by surfacing the gap between espoused values and values-in-action. Without this gap, interventions stay intellectual. The gap creates the emotional energy needed for change.

Horacio adds: Diagnostics exist specifically to open this gap — LSI vs. ideal, current team state vs. desired.

---

### Work Both Levels Simultaneously
*Sources: Dolo, Richi, Oseas*

> "Trabajás en la dimensión individual y en la dimensión colectiva en simultáneo... Son procesos paralelos." — Dolo
> "Para hacer un high performing team tienes a huevo que pasar por las dos cosas." — Oseas

Individual patterns CREATE team patterns. You can't separate individual development from team dynamics. HPT works both levels in parallel.

Individual skills (listening, speaking truth, checking inferences) are prerequisites for collective skills (good conversations, resolving disagreements). You can't skip the individual level.

---

### Trust Before Task
*Sources: Dolo, Horacio*

> "Sin esa confianza, no puedes hacer la verdad indiscutibles, no puedes tener conversaciones difíciles." — Dolo

This is about **sequencing of interventions within a team engagement**. When you start working with a team, you don't jump into accountability or role clarity. First sessions focus on:
1. Building trust and psychological safety
2. Clarifying purpose (why this team exists)
3. Creating burning platform (the gap)
4. Making operating agreements

Only AFTER this foundation is established can you work on harder things: execution, accountability, difficult conversations, role disputes. Without trust, people won't surface the real issues.

---

### Foreground/Background Flip
*Sources: Richi, Dolo, Horacio*

| Context | Foreground | Background |
|---------|------------|------------|
| **Offsites/Workshops** | Philosophy, principles, skills | Business context as examples |
| **Meeting Facilitation** | Business, actual work | Philosophy as intervention lens |
| **Individual Coaching** | Person | Team context |

The consultant must be fluent in BOTH modes and know when to use which. Same content, different emphasis depending on setting.

---

### Real Content Creates Real Learning
*Source: Richi*

> "Tiene que ser con algo que sea verdad... la condición para que funcione es que haya energía de verdad en la sala."

Learning anchors when it's about something the person actually cares about. Hypothetical examples don't stick. Work with actual situations, challenges, relationships.

---

### Diagnostic Drives Agenda
*Sources: Horacio, Dolo*

> "Si en promedio ese equipo contestó que claridad de roles está en 1.5, bueno, claramente eso lo voy a poner como agenda." — Horacio

Assessment results aren't just for awareness — they directly determine what you work on. Low score = that's the focus. The diagnostic becomes the intervention design.

---

### Interventions Vary by Team
*Sources: Dolo, Horacio*

> "No hay un manual, porque las intervenciones varían mucho de equipo a equipo... El consultor entiende cómo se combinan los elementos." — Dolo

Context shapes everything:
- Standalone HPT vs. part of culture transformation
- Team's current development stage
- Specific gaps from diagnostic

There's no fixed sequence. The consultant reads the situation and selects from a toolkit.

---

### Stewardship of AI
*Source: Dolo*

> "Yo creo que tiene que ser human led en general... necesitas el stewardship, necesitas la revisión de que eso tiene sentido."

Many things CAN be automated (assessment collection, pattern analysis, AI coaching, meeting minutes). But there needs to be a human in the loop who:
- Validates that outputs make sense
- Provides context interpretation
- Makes final decisions on interventions

This is about responsible use, not about AI's limitations.

---

### Social Context Increases Adherence
*Source: Oseas*

> "Una de las cosas que ayudan a la adhesión del cambio de comportamiento es el entorno social... Si estamos todos en equipo haciéndolo, está un poquito más cabrón."

Individual coaching alone has low adherence. The team framing helps because:
- External accountability
- Visible to peers
- Part of job responsibility (not personal choice)

---

### Individual is Mechanism, Team is Product
*Source: Oseas*

> "Cambia mucho la manera de poder abordar la cuestión comercial si el framing desde el principio es que tenemos una solución que se llama Team Performance."

Don't sell "individual coaching." Sell "Team Performance." Individual coaching is how you deliver it. Same work, different framing, better commercial traction.

**This is the mechanism for our MVP.** We work both levels simultaneously:
- **Team level:** Human consultant handles assessment, facilitation, offsites — the integration and glue
- **Personal level:** AI coach works with each individual — something that wasn't possible before at scale

The breakthrough: Previously, having a personal coach for everyone on a team was too expensive. AI coaching removes that constraint. The consultant can focus on team-level work while EVERY team member gets individual development support.

---

### Non-Negotiable Values Underpin Everything
*Source: Richi*

The CB philosophy has non-negotiable principles:
- Player vs Victim (own your life)
- Learner vs Knower (stay curious)
- Essential Integrity (behavior aligned with values moment to moment)
- System optimization (suboptimize subsystems to optimize the whole)

These are the "constitution" of the methodology. They shape what the system encourages and what it won't help with.

---

### Don't Announce, Model First
*Source: Richi*

> "No salgan a comunicar nada, más bien que practiquen... de manera que la gente les pregunte qué están haciendo."

Don't announce golden rules of behavior. Practice first, let people notice what's different, then communicate. Announcing rules creates skepticism → cynicism.

---

## 2. Methodology

Frameworks, processes, how things connect.

### Assessment Frameworks

**Two levels of assessment:**

| Level | Purpose | Options |
|-------|---------|---------|
| **Team** | How well the team functions as a team | 4-Quadrant (Axialent), Lencioni survey, OCI |
| **Individual** | Personal behavioral patterns | CB Assessment, LSI, DISC |

**Underlying frameworks:**

| Element | What It Is | Options |
|---------|-----------|---------|
| **Core Philosophy** | The principles that guide all work | CB (Conscious Business) — non-negotiable |
| **Team Effectiveness Theory** | Framework for understanding what makes teams work | Lencioni (5 Dysfunctions) OR Katzenbach |

**The specific instruments are choices.** You can use LSI or CB Assessment or DISC for individuals — depends on preference, cost, context. Same with team assessments.

**Where Axialent has IP:** The 4-Quadrant model is Axialent's operationalization of Katzenbach. It's a proprietary assessment instrument with:
- Survey (6-8 questions per quadrant, 1-5 scale)
- Visualization (concentric circles showing development)
- Historical data from past HPT engagements (benchmark potential)

---

### The 4-Quadrant Model

| Quadrant | Focus | What You Work On |
|----------|-------|------------------|
| **Purpose/Values/Objectives** | Why the team exists | Mission clarity, goal alignment |
| **Roles & Responsibilities** | Who does what | RACI, accountability |
| **Processes** | How work gets done | Meeting effectiveness, coordination |
| **Relationships** | Quality of conversations | CB skills, trust, psychological safety |

**Key insight (Horacio):** The Relationships quadrant is where CB teaching becomes most relevant. This is the entry point for CB in team context.

---

### Two Types of Diagnostic (Complementary)

| Type | Instruments | What It Tells You |
|------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Behavioral** | LSI, OCI, CB Assessment | What behaviors need to change, individual patterns |
| **Team Functioning** | 4-Quadrant | What the team needs to work on as a team |

These are complementary: 4-Quadrant tells you WHERE; behavioral tells you HOW.

---

### HPT Process Model

```
Context → Diagnostic → Interventions → Tracking
   ↓          ↓              ↓            ↓
Objectives  Team +       Workshops    Self-report
Goals      Individual    Facilitation   Leader check
Success    assessments   Coaching       Re-measure
criteria
```

---

### Three Dimensions of Team Effectiveness (I / Wi / It)

| Dimension | Focus | Indicators |
|-----------|-------|------------|
| **I** (Individual) | Person inspired by project | Engagement, career fit |
| **Wi** (We) | Relationship quality | Trust, psychological safety, no undiscussables |
| **It** (Purpose) | Collective meaning | Team has unique contribution |

Source: Richi (Katzenbach + Axialent adaptation)

---

### Three Intervention Tracks

| Track | What happens | Purpose |
|-------|--------------|---------|
| **Offsites** | Philosophy + business context | Learn frameworks using real business problems |
| **Meeting Facilitation** | Business + philosophy in background | Catch behaviors in flow, help honor stated intentions |
| **Individual Coaching** | Person + team context | Build skills that enable collective interdependence |

---

### "Ayúdame a Ayudarte" — The Bridge to Interdependence

> "No me estás ayudando a ayudarte" — Richi

When you need something, frame it in terms of serving the OTHER's agenda. This:
- Opens the listener's heart
- Removes defensiveness
- Makes you a giver, not a taker

**Why this is foundational:** This is the mechanism that transforms individual development into collective capability. Without this reframe, individual coaching doesn't compound into team effectiveness.

---

### Subject-Object Theory

> "Cuando tú eres sujeto de algo, no lo ves. Para verlo tenés que moverte afuera y hacerlo objeto de tu análisis." — Richi

Moving from subject to object = increasing consciousness. The coaching intervention helps people make automatic patterns visible (object) rather than invisible (subject).

This connects to Activity Theory: Operations (automatic) → Actions (conscious) → Activity (cultural). CB's core move is bringing the tacit UP.

---

## 3. Praxis Notes

Practical observations, tacit knowledge, the "how" behind the methodology.

### Role Modeling Creates Moments of Truth
*Source: Richi*

> "A través del role modeling, es como que creamos esos momentos de verdad que hacen que se ancle el aprendizaje."

When a coach demonstrates an alternative way to say something, in the moment, it creates an "aha" that sticks. This is the tacit skill that's hardest to digitize.

---

### Consultant Coherence
*Source: Richi*

> "El consultor ofrece una gran coherencia interna entre lo que está diciendo y cómo se comporta."

The coach must embody what they teach. Credibility comes from alignment between what you say and how you act. "Se comporta generando confianza, seguridad psicológica, se comporta diciendo su verdad."

---

### Zero Attachment to Direction
*Source: Richi*

> "Puedes hacer sugerencias, lo que no puedes es quedarte pegado a tu sugerencia."

The coach offers perspectives tentatively. If the coachee doesn't embrace it, fine. Zero attachment to pushing in a particular direction.

---

### Balance Investment Across Levels
*Source: Horacio*

If leader gets individual attention, team members should too (maybe less, but not zero). Western Union case was unusual — CEO got 6 coaching sessions, team got nothing individual. Horacio wouldn't recommend that imbalance.

---

### Opening the Gap
*Sources: Horacio, Richi*

The gap needs a "FROM" (current state) and a "TO" (desired state).

**The "TO" of the gap can be constructed in different ways:**

**Within culture transformation (Horacio's example):**
- Run OCI to capture desired team culture
- Compare against LSI results
- Gap = what each person needs to change to achieve desired culture

**More generally (Richi):**
The "TO" should cover all three dimensions:
- **It** — Desired business results state
- **Wi** — How we want to work together as a team
- **I** — Who each of us wants to become

Facilitating a conversation about the desired state across all 3 dimensions creates intrinsic motivation. It becomes a goal people genuinely want to achieve, not just an external target. (Connects to goal-setting theory — intrinsically motivating goals are more powerful.)

> "Siempre tenemos la oportunidad de abrir una brecha comportamental." — Horacio

---

### HPT = Component Assembly
*Source: Dolo*

There is NO separate "HPT methodology." HPT is the assembly of:
- Coaching (same handbook as Leadership Development)
- Teaching/Workshops (same playbook)
- Facilitation (unique skill — Skilled Facilitator)

> "La parte de skill building es la misma... tenés que mirarlo distinto, por eso tenés que entender el framework con el que lo estás mirando."

The consultant's skill is knowing HOW to combine these for a specific team's needs.

---

### Leader-First Pathway (For Dysfunctional Teams)
*Source: Oseas*

> "Ayúdale al líder del equipo a que esté menos jodido individualmente para que pueda autofacilitar un par de cosas a su equipo."

When team is too broken to self-facilitate:
1. Coach the leader first
2. Leader gains awareness + skills
3. Leader facilitates basic team conversations
4. Then broader team development

---

## 4. Design Implications

What this means for product.

### Start with Individual Coaching
*Confirmed by: All four sources*

Individual coaching is:
- More achievable NOW (methodology is more documented)
- The foundation for team effectiveness
- Scalable with AI
- Required for HPT anyway

The path: Individual coaching that works across sessions → extend to team context.

---

### Position as "Team Performance"
*Source: Oseas*

Don't build/sell "individual coaching." Build/sell "Team Performance."
- Individual coaching is a component, not the headline
- "Coaching" has budget/compliance blockers
- "Team Performance" has clearer organizational value

---

### Build Social Accountability In
*Source: Oseas*

Build team visibility into individual work:
- Dashboard showing adoption/progress
- Topics being worked on connected to team gaps
- Progress visible to peers

Individual work framed as team contribution increases adherence.

---

### Two Diagnostic Types Required
*Source: Horacio, confirmed by Dolo*

Any team assessment needs both:
1. **Team functioning** (4-Quadrant) → WHERE team is broken
2. **Individual behavioral** (CB Assessment or LSI) → HOW each person contributes

The cross-analysis is the "so what" — "Your team is weak on X, you're contributing via Y."

---

### Don't Replace the Consultant Yet
*Sources: Dolo, Oseas, Horacio*

Phase 1 approach: Consultant is the integration layer.
- Consultant handles team assessment interpretation
- Consultant designs and facilitates interventions
- AI handles scaled individual coaching

Learn by doing, observe opportunities, THEN expand tech.

---

### Account for Trust Sequencing
*Sources: Dolo, Horacio*

Any team-level features must account for trust level. Don't push accountability tools on teams that haven't built safety first.

Sequence: Trust/Purpose/Agreements → THEN execution/accountability.

---

### Relationships Quadrant = CB Entry Point
*Source: Horacio*

> "Cuando trabajamos sobre el cuadrante de relaciones, es lo que más directamente justifica el teaching del modelo de conscious business."

If one quadrant connects CB to teams, it's Relationships. This is the bridge between individual coaching and team effectiveness.

---

### Role Play / Practice Space
*Sources: Richi, Dolo*

AI can help users practice difficult conversations before having them:
- "What if you said it this way instead?"
- Role play with AI playing the other person
- Practice the "ayúdame a ayudarte" reframe

---

### Adaptive Pathways, Not Rigid Program
*Sources: Dolo, Horacio*

Can't create a rigid "HPT program." Need adaptive pathways based on:
- Diagnostic results (low scores drive agenda)
- Context (standalone vs. part of culture transformation)
- Team's development stage

---

### Capture the Reasoning, Not Just the Content
*Source: Horacio*

> "Los materiales no se autoexplican."

Digitization alone won't transfer expertise. Need to capture:
- The reasoning behind decisions
- The judgment calls
- The why, not just the what

---

### Meeting Facilitation Stays Human-Led (For Now)
*Source: Dolo*

Meeting facilitation is the unique HPT skill and the hardest to digitize. It stays human-led. AI opportunities:
- Pre-meeting prep
- Post-meeting reflection
- Dashboards (analysis, not real-time intervention)

---

## Open Questions for Vision

1. **MVP buyer:** HR or boss of team lead?
2. **Assessment mapping:** How exactly do 4-Quadrant results map to CB patterns?
3. **Differentiation validation:** How do we test that opinionated methodology matters to buyers?
4. **Trust measurement:** How do we know when a team has enough trust for accountability work?
5. **Facilitation future:** Is there ANY role for AI in meeting facilitation, or is it purely human?
