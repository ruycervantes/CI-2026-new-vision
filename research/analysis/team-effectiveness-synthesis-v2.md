## 1. The Problem

What gap does HPT close? Why do teams need intervention?

### Teams Underperform Because of Invisible Gaps

**Gap 1: Between espoused values and values-in-action**
> "La brecha es la materia prima para trabajar" — Richi

People say they want collaboration, trust, accountability — but their actual behavior contradicts this. They can't see the contradiction because they're *subject* to their patterns, not *object*.

**Gap 2: Between individual patterns and team needs**

Individual behavioral patterns (defensive, knower mode, victim stance) create team dysfunction. But the individual doesn't see how their pattern contributes to the team problem.

**Gap 3: Between current state and desired state**

Teams lack clarity on:
- **It** — What results do we want?
- **Wi** — How do we want to work together?
- **I** — Who do each of us want to become?

Without a compelling "TO" across all three dimensions, there's no intrinsic motivation to change.

### Why Teams Can't Fix This Alone

- **You can't see what you're subject to.** Patterns are invisible until someone helps you make them object.
- **You don't know what you don't know.** Teams lack the frameworks, methodology, understanding of what "good" looks like — and often don't even know what they're missing.
- **Teams lack the conditions for necessary conversations.** Without trust, safety, and skills, the hard conversations that would surface real issues don't happen. And sometimes trust is already broken — a different starting point than just "not built yet."

### The Fundamental Insight: Teams Are Created in Conversations

Teams don't exist apart from the conversations that constitute them. **Conversations are not just a tool for teamwork — they ARE the substance of teamwork.** Good conversations make teams; bad conversations break them.

This is why our interventions are fundamentally **language-based and symbol-based:**
- Helping individuals acquire new language tools
- Creating new distinctions (ways of seeing)
- Shifting mindsets
- Building new narratives and ways of looking at things

The goal: enable people to behave differently and create something greater than the sum of its parts.

**Why AI matters here:** AI can process language in ways that were reserved for humans until recently. Since the interventions are language-based, AI has a natural fit. The ability to work with words, distinctions, narratives, and meaning — at scale — is what makes AI-powered team effectiveness possible.

## 2. The Mechanisms

How does change actually happen? What creates real improvement?

### Mechanism 1: Opening the Gap (Creating Awareness)

Change requires seeing the gap between where you are and where you want to be. This is emotional, not just intellectual.

**How it works:**
- Assessments surface current state (team functioning + individual patterns)
- Facilitated conversation creates desired state across I/Wi/It dimensions
- The gap becomes visible and felt — creating energy for change

**Why it works:**
The gap creates intrinsic motivation. When people genuinely want the "TO" (not just told they should want it), they have energy to change.

---

### Mechanism 2: Trust as Foundation

> "Sin esa confianza, no puedes hacer la verdad indiscutibles" — Dolo

You can't do the hard work (accountability, difficult conversations, surfacing undiscussables) without psychological safety first.

**How it works:**
- First sessions focus on trust-building, purpose clarification, operating agreements
- Only AFTER this foundation → execution skills, accountability, hard feedback

**Why it works:**
Without safety, people protect themselves. They won't surface real issues. The intervention stays superficial.

---

### Mechanism 3: Working Both Levels Simultaneously

> "Para hacer un high performing team tienes a huevo que pasar por las dos cosas" — Oseas

Individual patterns CREATE team patterns. You can't fix the team without changing individual behavior. But individual change without team context doesn't stick.

**How it works:**
- Team-level: Assessments, offsites, facilitated meetings, shared artifacts
- Individual-level: Coaching, reflection, skill-building
- Run in parallel, connected to each other

**Why it works:**
- Individual skills (listening, speaking truth) are prerequisites for collective skills (good conversations)
- Team context creates social accountability that helps individual change stick
- Cross-referencing ("your team is weak on X, you contribute via Y") makes individual work relevant

---

### Mechanism 4: Social Accountability

> "Una de las cosas que ayudan a la adhesión del cambio de comportamiento es el entorno social" — Oseas

Individual coaching alone has low adherence. Team context changes this.

**How it works:**
- Individual work is framed as contribution to team (not personal development)
- Progress is visible to peers
- Commitment is to the team, not just to yourself

**Why it works:**
External accountability + peer visibility + shared commitment = higher adherence than solo effort.

---

### Mechanism 5: Real Content Creates Real Learning

> "Tiene que ser con algo que sea verdad... la condición para que funcione es que haya energía de verdad en la sala" — Richi

Hypothetical examples don't stick. Learning anchors when it's about something the person actually cares about.

**How it works:**
- Work with actual situations, challenges, relationships
- Business content is the material for learning (not separate "training" content)
- The real stakes create real engagement

**Why it works:**
Energy and emotion are required for change. Fake scenarios don't generate them.

---

### Mechanism 6: Subject → Object (Making the Invisible Visible)

> "Cuando tú eres sujeto de algo, no lo ves. Para verlo tenés que moverte afuera y hacerlo objeto de tu análisis" — Richi

You can't change what you can't see. The intervention makes automatic patterns visible.

**How it works:**
- Naming patterns in the moment ("you're in knower mode right now")
- Reflecting on what happened after the fact
- Role modeling alternatives ("what if you said it this way?")

**Why it works:**
Once something is visible (object), you can choose differently. While it's invisible (subject), it runs you.

## 3. The Interventions

What do you actually DO? The concrete activities.

### Assessment (Diagnose)

**Purpose:** Surface current state, identify gaps, create data for intervention design

| Level | What You Assess | Instruments |
|-------|-----------------|-------------|
| **Team** | How well the team functions | 4-Quadrant (Axialent), Lencioni, OCI |
| **Individual** | Personal behavioral patterns | CB Assessment, LSI, DISC |

**Key principle: Diagnostic drives agenda.** Low score on roles? That's what you work on. Low score on relationships? That's where CB teaching comes in.

**Cross-analysis creates the "so what":** "Your team is weak on X, you're contributing via Y."

---

### Offsites / Workshops (Teach + Build Artifacts)

**Purpose:** Transfer frameworks, build shared understanding, create team artifacts

**What happens:**
- Philosophy/principles in foreground, business context as examples
- Build shared artifacts: purpose statement, operating agreements, RACI, norms
- Facilitated conversations about desired state (I/Wi/It)

**Sequencing:**
1. Trust-building
2. Purpose/Why clarification
3. Burning platform (the gap)
4. Operating agreements
5. THEN execution skills, accountability

---

### Meeting Facilitation (In the Flow)

**Purpose:** Catch behaviors in real work, help team honor stated intentions

**What happens:**
- Business content in foreground, philosophy as intervention lens
- Facilitator observes and names patterns ("that was knower mode")
- Helps team practice new behaviors in real stakes

**Why it matters:**
This is where change either happens or doesn't. Offsites create intentions; facilitated meetings test whether they become real.

---

### Individual Coaching (Personal Development)

**Purpose:** Build individual skills that enable collective performance

**What happens:**
- Reflect on flow of work against shared accords
- Identify personal gaps and patterns
- Practice alternative approaches (role play)
- Build skills: listening, speaking truth, checking inferences

**Connection to team:**
Individual coaching is always in context of team goals. "How did your pattern show up in that meeting? What could you do differently?"

---

## 4. The Design Logic

Why is HPT structured this way? What principles drive the design?

### Logic 1: Trust Before Task

You can't push accountability tools on a team that hasn't built safety. The system must respect sequencing — or not assume trust exists.

---

### Logic 2: Foreground/Background Flip

Same content, different emphasis by context:

| Context | Foreground | Background |
|---------|------------|------------|
| Offsites | Philosophy, principles | Business context |
| Facilitation | Business, real work | Philosophy as lens |
| Coaching | Person | Team context |

The consultant flips between these modes based on setting.

---

### Logic 3: Adaptive Pathways, Not Rigid Program

> "No hay un manual, porque las intervenciones varían mucho de equipo a equipo" — Dolo

No fixed sequence. The consultant reads:
- Diagnostic results (what's broken)
- Context (standalone vs. part of culture transformation)
- Team's development stage

And selects from a toolkit accordingly.

---

### Logic 4: Individual is Mechanism, Team is Product

> "Cambia mucho la manera de poder abordar la cuestión comercial si el framing desde el principio es que tenemos una solución que se llama Team Performance" — Oseas

Position as "Team Performance." Individual coaching is how you deliver it — but it's not the product identity.

---

### Logic 5: Stewardship of AI

> "Necesitas el stewardship, necesitas la revisión de que eso tiene sentido" — Dolo

Many things CAN be automated. But maintain human oversight for:
- Validation that outputs make sense
- Context interpretation
- Final decisions on interventions

This is about responsible use, not limitation.

---

### Logic 6: Non-Negotiable Values

The CB philosophy has principles that can't be compromised:
- Player vs Victim (own your life)
- Learner vs Knower (stay curious)
- Essential Integrity (behavior aligned with values)
- System optimization (suboptimize self for the whole)

These are the "constitution." They shape what the system encourages and what it won't help with.

---

## 5. Human vs. Structure

What the consultant currently does vs. what could be structurally embedded in technology.

### What the Human Consultant Does Today

| Function | What They Do |
|----------|--------------|
| **Read the diagnostic** | Interpret results, identify priorities, decide what to focus on |
| **Sequence interventions** | Know when team is ready for harder work, respect trust-before-task |
| **Flip foreground/background** | Adjust emphasis in real-time based on context |
| **Catch moments** | Notice patterns in the flow, name them, intervene |
| **Hold the thread** | Remember what happened across sessions, connect dots |
| **Model alternatives** | Demonstrate different ways to say things, in the moment |
| **Integration** | Combine coaching + teaching + facilitation based on team needs |
| **Judgment** | Decide what's appropriate, adapt to context, handle exceptions |

---

### What Could Be Structurally Embedded (Tech-Led)

| Human Function | Possible Tech Alternative |
|----------------|---------------------------|
| **Read diagnostic** | Recommendation engine: "You scored low on X, here's the intervention" |
| **Sequence interventions** | Gated progression: System unlocks features based on readiness metrics |
| **Flip foreground/background** | Different product modes: Learning mode vs. Work mode |
| **Catch moments** | Dashboards, async prompts, AI observation of meetings |
| **Hold the thread** | Memory across sessions, pattern recognition, longitudinal tracking |
| **Model alternatives** | AI role play, suggested phrasings, practice conversations |
| **Integration** | Product pathways that combine components based on assessment |
| **Judgment** | Rules + AI interpretation — but with human stewardship |

---

### What's Essential vs. Contingent

**Essential (must be preserved in any design):**
- The mechanisms of change (gap awareness, trust foundation, both levels, social accountability)
- The non-negotiable values (CB philosophy)
- Working with real content (not hypotheticals)
- Subject → object move (making invisible visible)

**Contingent (could be done differently):**
- Human as the integration layer (could be product structure)
- Live facilitation as the primary flow-of-work intervention (could be dashboards, async)
- In-person offsites as the teaching mechanism (could be other formats)
- Consultant judgment as the sequencing mechanism (could be gated systems)

---

### The Hybrid MVP

For now:
- **Team level:** Human consultant handles assessment interpretation, facilitation, offsites
- **Personal level:** AI coach handles individual development (scales what wasn't possible before)

The consultant is still the integration layer. But we learn by doing — observing where technology could support or replace.

---

### The Future Question

**Can the structure itself do what the consultant does?**

A fully tech-led team effectiveness product would need to:
1. Assess and recommend (diagnostic → intervention mapping)
2. Sequence appropriately (respect trust-before-task)
3. Work both levels (team artifacts + individual coaching)
4. Create social accountability (visibility, shared commitment)
5. Catch moments (observation + naming patterns)
6. Hold the thread (memory + longitudinal patterns)

Some of these are closer than others. The hybrid MVP lets us learn which ones are ready and which need more human support.

## Appendix: Assessment Framework Details

### Two Levels of Assessment

| Level | Purpose | Options |
|-------|---------|---------|
| **Team** | How well the team functions | 4-Quadrant (Axialent), Lencioni survey, OCI |
| **Individual** | Personal behavioral patterns | CB Assessment, LSI, DISC |

### Underlying Frameworks

| Element | What It Is | Options |
|---------|-----------|---------|
| **Core Philosophy** | Principles that guide all work | CB (Conscious Business) — non-negotiable |
| **Team Effectiveness Theory** | Framework for understanding teams | Lencioni (5 Dysfunctions) OR Katzenbach |

### The 4-Quadrant Model (Axialent IP)

| Quadrant | Focus | What You Work On |
|----------|-------|------------------|
| **Purpose/Values/Objectives** | Why the team exists | Mission clarity, goal alignment |
| **Roles & Responsibilities** | Who does what | RACI, accountability |
| **Processes** | How work gets done | Meeting effectiveness, coordination |
| **Relationships** | Quality of conversations | CB skills, trust, psychological safety |

**Relationships quadrant = CB entry point.** This is where CB teaching becomes most relevant in team context.

---

## Appendix: Three Dimensions (I / Wi / It)

| Dimension | Focus | Indicators |
|-----------|-------|------------|
| **I** (Individual) | Person inspired by project | Engagement, career fit |
| **Wi** (We) | Relationship quality | Trust, psychological safety, no undiscussables |
| **It** (Purpose) | Collective meaning | Team has unique contribution |

The "TO" of the gap should cover all three dimensions to create intrinsic motivation.
