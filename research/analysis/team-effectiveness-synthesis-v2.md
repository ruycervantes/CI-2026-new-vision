## 0. The Mental Model

Key concepts that orient everything else.

### What Is a Team?

> "A team is a small number of people with complementary skills who are committed to a common purpose, performance goals, and approach for which they hold themselves mutually accountable." — Katzenbach & Smith

Not every group is a team. A **working group** has a strong leader, individual accountability, and individual work products. A **team** has shared leadership, mutual accountability, and collective work products. The intervention must help groups understand what level of interdependency they actually need.

### What Makes a Team Effective?

**Team effectiveness = 4 things working together:**

| Quadrant | What It Means |
|----------|---------------|
| **Purpose** | Shared mission, values, goals — why we exist |
| **Roles** | Who does what, who's accountable for what |
| **Processes** | How we work together — meetings, decisions, coordination |
| **Relationships** | Trust, conversation quality, ability to have hard conversations |

Most teams fail on **Relationships** — and that's where CB philosophy enters. But you can't fix relationships without clarity on Purpose, Roles, and Processes.

### What Does Success Look Like?

Effectiveness means success on **three dimensions (I/Wi/It):**

| Dimension | What It Means |
|-----------|---------------|
| **It** (Results) | The team delivers business results |
| **Wi** (We) | The team is healthy — trust exists, hard conversations happen |
| **I** (Individual) | Members are thriving, developing, feel meaning in the work |

A team that only hits results (It) but burns people out (I) or has toxic dynamics (Wi) is not truly effective.

### How Does Change Happen?

**The BE → DO → HAVE model:**

```
        ┌─────────────┐
        │    HAVE     │  ← Results (visible)
~~~~~~~~│~~~~~~~~~~~~~│~~~~~~~~ waterline
        │     DO      │  ← Behaviors
        │     BE      │  ← Mindsets, values, beliefs (deep)
        └─────────────┘
```

- You can't change **HAVE** (results) directly
- Changing **DO** (behaviors) doesn't stick without changing **BE** (mindsets)
- Most interventions fail because they only work at the DO level
- CB works at the BE level — so new behaviors become natural

### What Is HPT?

**HPT (High Performance Teams)** is Axialent's methodology for improving team effectiveness. It combines:
- **Assessment** — Diagnose all 4 quadrants + individual patterns
- **Skill building** — Workshops on CB philosophy and practices
- **Coaching** — Individual development connected to team context
- **Facilitation** — Catch patterns in real work, help team honor intentions

The methodology works at the **BE level** across all four quadrants, with particular emphasis on **Relationships** — because that's where trust, authentic communication, and the ability to surface undiscussables live.

---

## 1. The Problem

What gap does HPT close? Why do teams need intervention?

### Teams Underperform Because of Invisible Gaps

**Gap 1: Between espoused values and values-in-action**
> "La brecha es la materia prima para trabajar" — Richi

People say they want collaboration, trust, accountability — but their actual behavior contradicts this. They can't see the contradiction because they're *subject* to their patterns, not *object*.

**Gap 2: Between individual patterns and team needs**

Individual behavioral patterns (defensive, knower mode, victim stance) create team dysfunction. But the individual doesn't see how their pattern contributes to the team problem.

**Gap 3: Between current state and desired state**

Teams lack clarity on:
- **It** — What results do we want?
- **Wi** — How do we want to work together?
- **I** — Who do each of us want to become?

Without a compelling "TO" across all three dimensions, there's no intrinsic motivation to change.

### Why Teams Can't Fix This Alone

- **You can't see what you're subject to.** Patterns are invisible until someone helps you make them object.
- **You don't know what you don't know.** Teams lack the frameworks, methodology, understanding of what "good" looks like — and often don't even know what they're missing.
- **Teams lack the conditions for necessary conversations.** Without trust, safety, and skills, the hard conversations that would surface real issues don't happen. And sometimes trust is already broken — a different starting point than just "not built yet."

### The Fundamental Insight: Teams Are Created in Conversations

Teams don't exist apart from the conversations that constitute them. **Conversations are not just a tool for teamwork — they ARE the substance of teamwork.** Good conversations make teams; bad conversations break them.

This is why our interventions are fundamentally **language-based and symbol-based:**
- Helping individuals acquire new language tools
- Creating new distinctions (ways of seeing)
- Shifting mindsets
- Building new narratives and ways of looking at things

The goal: enable people to behave differently and create something greater than the sum of its parts.

**Why AI matters here:** AI can process language in ways that were reserved for humans until recently. Since the interventions are language-based, AI has a natural fit. The ability to work with words, distinctions, narratives, and meaning — at scale — is what makes AI-powered team effectiveness possible.

### Context Determines the Conversation

Setting the right context is key to making conversations successful. The same content, with a different frame, becomes a completely different conversation.

**"Ayúdame a ayudarte" is the clearest example.** When you need something from someone:
- Frame A: "I need X from you" → defensive, transactional
- Frame B: "Help me help you — how can I better serve your agenda?" → opens hearts, creates collaboration

Same underlying need. Completely different conversation. The reframe sets context that makes success possible.

This is a core intervention pattern: **help people set better contexts for their conversations.** New language tools, new distinctions, new frames — these change the context, which changes the conversation, which changes the outcome.

---

## 2. The Mechanisms

How does change actually happen? What creates real improvement?

### The Iceberg: BE → DO → HAVE

This is the foundational model for understanding how change works.

```
        ┌─────────────┐
        │    HAVE     │  ← Results (visible)
        │   results   │
~~~~~~~~│~~~~~~~~~~~~~│~~~~~~~~ waterline
        │     DO      │  ← Behaviors (invisible)
        │  behaviors  │
        │             │
        │     BE      │  ← Mental models, values, beliefs (deep)
        │  mindsets   │
        └─────────────┘
```

**High Performance = Consciousness + Skill**

| Level | What It Is |
|-------|-----------|
| **BE** (Consciousness) | Mental models, values, beliefs |
| **DO** (Skill) | Behaviors, practices |
| **HAVE** | Results |

The specific CB values and skills are detailed in **Logic 6: The Foundational Accord**.

**Why this matters:**
- You can't change HAVE (results) directly
- You can try to change DO (behaviors), but it won't stick without changing BE (mindsets)
- Most interventions fail because they work only at the DO level
- CB works at the BE level — changing mental models so that new behaviors become natural

**The leverage is in the invisible.** The deeper you go in the iceberg, the more leverage you have — but the harder it is to see and change.

---

### Mechanism 1: Opening the Gap (Creating Awareness)

Change requires seeing the gap between where you are and where you want to be. This is emotional, not just intellectual.

**How it works:**
- Assessments surface current state (team functioning + individual patterns)
- Facilitated conversation creates desired state across I/Wi/It dimensions
- The gap becomes visible and felt — creating energy for change

**Why it works:**
The gap creates intrinsic motivation. When people genuinely want the "TO" (not just told they should want it), they have energy to change.

---

### Mechanism 2: Trust as Foundation

> "Sin esa confianza, no puedes hacer la verdad indiscutibles" — Dolo

You can't do the hard work (accountability, difficult conversations, surfacing undiscussables) without psychological safety first.

**How it works:**
- First sessions focus on trust-building, purpose clarification, operating agreements
- Only AFTER this foundation → execution skills, accountability, hard feedback

**Why it works:**
Without safety, people protect themselves. They won't surface real issues. The intervention stays superficial.

---

### Mechanism 3: Working Both Levels Simultaneously

> "Para hacer un high performing team tienes a huevo que pasar por las dos cosas" — Oseas

Individual patterns CREATE team patterns. You can't fix the team without changing individual behavior. But individual change without team context doesn't stick.

**How it works:**
- Team-level: Assessments, offsites, facilitated meetings, shared artifacts
- Individual-level: Coaching, reflection, skill-building
- Run in parallel, connected to each other

**Why it works:**
- Individual skills (listening, speaking truth) are prerequisites for collective skills (good conversations)
- Team context creates social accountability that helps individual change stick
- Cross-referencing ("your team is weak on X, you contribute via Y") makes individual work relevant

---

### Mechanism 4: Social Accountability

> "Una de las cosas que ayudan a la adhesión del cambio de comportamiento es el entorno social" — Oseas

Individual coaching alone has low adherence. Team context changes this.

**How it works:**
- Individual work is framed as contribution to team (not personal development)
- Progress is visible to peers
- Commitment is to the team, not just to yourself

**Why it works:**
External accountability + peer visibility + shared commitment = higher adherence than solo effort.

---

### Mechanism 5: Real Content Creates Real Learning

> "Tiene que ser con algo que sea verdad... la condición para que funcione es que haya energía de verdad en la sala" — Richi

Hypothetical examples don't stick. Learning anchors when it's about something the person actually cares about.

**How it works:**
- Work with actual situations, challenges, relationships
- Business content is the material for learning (not separate "training" content)
- The real stakes create real engagement

**Why it works:**
Energy and emotion are required for change. Fake scenarios don't generate them.

---

### Mechanism 6: Subject → Object (Making the Invisible Visible)

> "Cuando tú eres sujeto de algo, no lo ves. Para verlo tenés que moverte afuera y hacerlo objeto de tu análisis" — Richi

You can't change what you can't see. The intervention makes automatic patterns visible.

**How it works:**
- Naming patterns in the moment ("you're in knower mode right now")
- Reflecting on what happened after the fact
- Role modeling alternatives ("what if you said it this way?")

**Why it works:**
Once something is visible (object), you can choose differently. While it's invisible (subject), it runs you.

---

## 3. The Interventions

What do you actually DO? The concrete activities.

### Assessment (Diagnose)

**Purpose:** Surface current state, identify gaps, create data for intervention design

| Level | What You Assess | Instruments |
|-------|-----------------|-------------|
| **Team** | How well the team functions | 4-Quadrant (Axialent), Lencioni, OCI |
| **Individual** | Personal behavioral patterns | CB Assessment, LSI, DISC |

**Key principle: Diagnostic drives agenda.** Low score on roles? That's what you work on. Low score on relationships? That's where CB teaching comes in.

**Cross-analysis creates the "so what":** "Your team is weak on X, you're contributing via Y."

---

### Offsites / Workshops (Teach + Build Artifacts)

**Purpose:** Transfer frameworks, build shared understanding, create team artifacts

**What happens:**
- Philosophy/principles in foreground, business context as examples
- Build shared artifacts: purpose statement, operating agreements, RACI, norms
- Facilitated conversations about desired state (I/Wi/It)

**Sequencing:**
1. Trust-building
2. Purpose/Why clarification
3. Burning platform (the gap)
4. Operating agreements
5. THEN execution skills, accountability

---

### Meeting Facilitation (In the Flow)

**Purpose:** Catch behaviors in real work, help team honor stated intentions

**What happens:**
- Business content in foreground, philosophy as intervention lens
- Facilitator observes and names patterns ("that was knower mode")
- Helps team practice new behaviors in real stakes

**Why it matters:**
This is where change either happens or doesn't. Offsites create intentions; facilitated meetings test whether they become real.

---

### Individual Coaching (Personal Development)

**Purpose:** Build individual skills that enable collective performance

**What happens:**
- Reflect on flow of work against shared accords
- Identify personal gaps and patterns
- Practice alternative approaches (role play)
- Build skills: listening, speaking truth, checking inferences

**Connection to team:**
Individual coaching is always in context of team goals. "How did your pattern show up in that meeting? What could you do differently?"

---

## 4. The Design Logic

Why is HPT structured this way? What principles drive the design?

### Logic 1: Trust Before Task

You can't push accountability tools on a team that hasn't built safety. The system must respect sequencing — or not assume trust exists.

---

### Logic 2: Foreground/Background Flip

Same content, different emphasis by context:

| Context | Foreground | Background |
|---------|------------|------------|
| Offsites | Philosophy, principles | Business context |
| Facilitation | Business, real work | Philosophy as lens |
| Coaching | Person | Team context |

The consultant flips between these modes based on setting.

---

### Logic 3: Adaptive Pathways, Not Rigid Program

> "No hay un manual, porque las intervenciones varían mucho de equipo a equipo" — Dolo

No fixed sequence. The consultant reads:
- Diagnostic results (what's broken)
- Context (standalone vs. part of culture transformation)
- Team's development stage

And selects from a toolkit accordingly.

---

### Logic 4: Individual is Mechanism, Team is Product

> "Cambia mucho la manera de poder abordar la cuestión comercial si el framing desde el principio es que tenemos una solución que se llama Team Performance" — Oseas

Position as "Team Performance." Individual coaching is how you deliver it — but it's not the product identity.

---

### Logic 5: Stewardship of AI

> "Necesitas el stewardship, necesitas la revisión de que eso tiene sentido" — Dolo

Many things CAN be automated. But maintain human oversight for:
- Validation that outputs make sense
- Context interpretation
- Final decisions on interventions

This is about responsible use, not limitation.

---

### Logic 6: The Foundational Accord

The product isn't values-neutral. It **embodies** a specific philosophy in how it behaves — and it **invites** users who share these values to develop themselves.

This is a mutual contract: the product commits to behaving according to these principles, and the user commits to developing toward them. This accord is the basis of the relationship.

**The Values (Consciousness + Skill):**

| Consciousness (BE) | What It Means |
|--------------------|---------------|
| **Unconditional responsibility** | Own your response to any situation |
| **Ontological humility** | Your view is a view, not THE truth |
| **Essential integrity** | Behavior aligned with values moment to moment |
| **Positive-sum thinking** | Optimize the system, not just yourself |

| Skill (DO) | What It Means |
|------------|---------------|
| **Authentic communication** | Say what you mean, mean what you say |
| **Impeccable coordination** | Make and keep commitments reliably |
| **Constructive negotiation** | Resolve differences to create value |

**What This Means for Product Design:**

| The Product WILL... | The Product WON'T... |
|---------------------|----------------------|
| Help you take responsibility for your response | Help you blame others or circumstances |
| Challenge your assumptions with curiosity | Confirm your existing biases |
| Help you align behavior with stated values | Help you justify incongruent behavior |
| Encourage win-win solutions | Optimize for you at others' expense |
| Support honest, direct communication | Help you manipulate or avoid hard truths |
| Build commitment-keeping habits | Enable excuse-making or avoidance |

This is the "constitution" — it shapes what the system encourages and what it won't help with. Users who don't share these values won't get value from the product.

---

### Logic 7: Real Change Takes ~90 Days

This is a **design constraint**, not just an operational rhythm. Meaningful behavioral change takes approximately 90 days to become habitual. This is the time it takes for new patterns to move from conscious effort to automatic behavior.

**Implications for product design:**

| Don't... | Do... |
|----------|-------|
| Promise quick fixes | Build for sustained engagement over quarters |
| Measure success in sessions | Measure progress across cycles |
| Optimize for initial activation | Optimize for 90-day retention and change |
| Let users quit when it gets hard | Design for the "dip" in the middle |

**The cycle structure:**

```
    DIAGNOSE → PLAN → EXECUTE → REVIEW
         ↑                         |
         └─────────────────────────┘
                  ~90 DAYS
```

| Phase | What Happens |
|-------|-------------|
| **Diagnose** | Surface current state (assessment, observation) |
| **Plan** | Design intervention based on diagnostic |
| **Execute** | Skill building, practice, real-work application |
| **Review** | Measure progress, learn, adjust for next cycle |

The cycle repeats. Each iteration builds on the last. A team that goes through 3-4 cycles over a year sees compounding progress — not because of more content, but because patterns have time to stick.

---

## 5. Human vs. Structure

What the consultant currently does vs. what could be structurally embedded in technology.

### What the Human Consultant Does Today

| Function | What They Do |
|----------|--------------|
| **Read the diagnostic** | Interpret results, identify priorities, decide what to focus on |
| **Sequence interventions** | Know when team is ready for harder work, respect trust-before-task |
| **Flip foreground/background** | Adjust emphasis in real-time based on context |
| **Catch moments** | Notice patterns in the flow, name them, intervene |
| **Hold the thread** | Remember what happened across sessions, connect dots |
| **Model alternatives** | Demonstrate different ways to say things, in the moment |
| **Integration** | Combine coaching + teaching + facilitation based on team needs |
| **Judgment** | Decide what's appropriate, adapt to context, handle exceptions |

---

### What Could Be Structurally Embedded (Tech-Led)

| Human Function | Possible Tech Alternative |
|----------------|---------------------------|
| **Read diagnostic** | Recommendation engine: "You scored low on X, here's the intervention" |
| **Sequence interventions** | Gated progression: System unlocks features based on readiness metrics |
| **Flip foreground/background** | Different product modes: Learning mode vs. Work mode |
| **Catch moments** | Dashboards, async prompts, AI observation of meetings |
| **Hold the thread** | Memory across sessions, pattern recognition, longitudinal tracking |
| **Model alternatives** | AI role play, suggested phrasings, practice conversations |
| **Integration** | Product pathways that combine components based on assessment |
| **Judgment** | Rules + AI interpretation — but with human stewardship |

---

### What's Essential vs. Contingent

**Essential (must be preserved in any design):**
- The mechanisms of change (gap awareness, trust foundation, both levels, social accountability)
- The non-negotiable values (CB philosophy)
- Working with real content (not hypotheticals)
- Subject → object move (making invisible visible)

**Contingent (could be done differently):**
- Human as the integration layer (could be product structure)
- Live facilitation as the primary flow-of-work intervention (could be dashboards, async)
- In-person offsites as the teaching mechanism (could be other formats)
- Consultant judgment as the sequencing mechanism (could be gated systems)

---

### The Hybrid MVP

For now:
- **Team level:** Human consultant handles assessment interpretation, facilitation, offsites
- **Personal level:** AI coach handles individual development (scales what wasn't possible before)

The consultant is still the integration layer. But we learn by doing — observing where technology could support or replace.

---

### The Future Question

**Can the structure itself do what the consultant does?**

A fully tech-led team effectiveness product would need to:
1. Assess and recommend (diagnostic → intervention mapping)
2. Sequence appropriately (respect trust-before-task)
3. Work both levels (team artifacts + individual coaching)
4. Create social accountability (visibility, shared commitment)
5. Catch moments (observation + naming patterns)
6. Hold the thread (memory + longitudinal patterns)

Some of these are closer than others. The hybrid MVP lets us learn which ones are ready and which need more human support.

## Appendix: Assessment Framework Details

### Two Levels of Assessment

| Level | Purpose | Options |
|-------|---------|---------|
| **Team** | How well the team functions | 4-Quadrant (Axialent), Lencioni survey, OCI |
| **Individual** | Personal behavioral patterns | CB Assessment, LSI, DISC |

### Underlying Frameworks

| Element | What It Is | Options |
|---------|-----------|---------|
| **Core Philosophy** | Principles that guide all work | CB (Conscious Business) — non-negotiable |
| **Team Effectiveness Theory** | Framework for understanding teams | Lencioni (5 Dysfunctions) OR Katzenbach |

### The 4-Quadrant Model (Axialent IP)

| Quadrant | Focus | What You Work On |
|----------|-------|------------------|
| **Purpose/Values/Objectives** | Why the team exists | Mission clarity, goal alignment |
| **Roles & Responsibilities** | Who does what | RACI, accountability |
| **Processes** | How work gets done | Meeting effectiveness, coordination |
| **Relationships** | Quality of conversations | CB skills, trust, psychological safety |

**Relationships quadrant = CB entry point.** This is where CB teaching becomes most relevant in team context.

---

## Appendix: Three Dimensions (I / Wi / It)

| Dimension | Focus | Indicators |
|-----------|-------|------------|
| **I** (Individual) | Person inspired by project | Engagement, career fit |
| **Wi** (We) | Relationship quality | Trust, psychological safety, no undiscussables |
| **It** (Purpose) | Collective meaning | Team has unique contribution |

The "TO" of the gap should cover all three dimensions to create intrinsic motivation.

---

## Appendix: Maturity Levels by Quadrant

Each quadrant has three levels: Sub-Optimal → Standard → High Performance.

### Purpose/Values/Culture

| Level | Characteristics |
|-------|----------------|
| **Sub-Optimal** | Unclear or disagreement about goals. No shared vision or values. No unique team purpose. |
| **Standard** | Clear purpose and how it supports strategy. Defined code of value-based behaviors. Agreed measures. |
| **High Performance** | Mission generates powerful shared purpose. Breakthrough objectives come from within (not externally driven). "Let's see how good we can get!" |

### Roles/Accountabilities

| Level | Characteristics |
|-------|----------------|
| **Sub-Optimal** | Roles not defined. Overlaps and gaps create disruption. Interdependencies not understood. |
| **Standard** | Each role defined with right metric. Interdependencies defined. Individual contributions linked to team goals. |
| **High Performance** | "My word is my bond." Mutual accountability — if one falls, all help. Wise sacrifices for team optimization. |

### Processes

| Level | Characteristics |
|-------|----------------|
| **Sub-Optimal** | Interactions unstructured and chaotic. No defined output or agenda. Communication breakdowns. |
| **Standard** | Effective meetings (right topics, right people). Clear output and agenda. Appropriate communication systems. |
| **High Performance** | Flex rules to become faster. Processes are organic, not mechanistic. "More with less" essence. After-action reviews following each project. |

### Relationships

| Level | Characteristics |
|-------|----------------|
| **Sub-Optimal** | Shallow politeness covering mistrust. Silo-focused, self-promotion. Transactional exchanges only. |
| **Standard** | Understand each other's styles. Differing viewpoints spoken and heard. Trust in competence and support. |
| **High Performance** | No undiscussables — everything on the table. Productive inquiry and active listening. Team members seen as friends. Attracts talent. |

---

## Appendix: The Promise Framework (Accountability)

A framework for building accountability in the Roles quadrant.

**Core Principles:**
1. Negotiated contract between two parties
2. "My word is my bond"
3. Countable, tangible, visible

```
                    Being Accountable
         ┌──────────────────┬──────────────────┐
         │  Before Promise  │  After Promise   │
         │                  │                  │
         │ • Self-set goals │ • Managing risk  │
         │ • Anticipate risk│ • Keeping score  │
         │ • Make promises  │ • Keeping word   │
         │ • Planning       │ • Stay focused   │
         │ • Personal resp. │ • Self-motivate  │
         ├──────────────────┼──────────────────┤
         │  Before Promise  │  After Promise   │
         │                  │                  │
         │ • Engage others  │ • Hold ground    │
         │ • Asking         │ • Keep heat on   │
         │ • Get commits    │ • Manage failure │
         │ • Influencing    │ • Reward success │
         └──────────────────┴──────────────────┘
                Holding Others to Account
```

**The promise has three dimensions:**
- **Objective** — what will be delivered
- **Measures** — how success is counted
- **Transparent** — visible to all parties

---

## Appendix: Teams vs. Working Groups (Katzenbach)

Background theory on what distinguishes a team from a working group.

### Not All Groups Are Teams

Before improving a team, you need to understand: **is this actually a team, or just a working group?**

| Working Group | Team |
|---------------|------|
| Strong, clearly focused leader | Shared leadership roles |
| Individual accountability | Individual AND mutual accountability |
| Purpose = broader organizational mission | Specific team purpose the team itself delivers |
| Individual work products | Collective work products |
| Informational meetings | Problem-solving meetings |
| Discusses, decides, delegates | Discusses, decides, does real work together |

**Katzenbach's definition:** "A team is a small number of people with complementary skills who are committed to a common purpose, performance goals, and approach for which they hold themselves mutually accountable."

**Why this matters for design:** Not every group SHOULD be a team. Sometimes a working group is the right structure. The intervention must help groups understand what level of interdependency they actually need — and build toward that, not more.

### Choosing the Level of Interdependency

Teams should consciously choose HOW to team based on the task at hand.

**The sports metaphor:**
- **Swimming team** (low interdependency): Individual performances, no tradeoffs, 1+1=2
- **Soccer team** (high interdependency): Continuous coordination, high synergies, 1+1>2
- **Baseball team** (adaptive): Plays as cohesive unit in the field, individual batters at the plate

**High-performing teams operate like baseball teams** — they have the flexibility to adapt and the competency to understand whether to address each task as a workgroup or a team.

Some topics need full team collaboration (strategy, budgeting, people decisions). Others can be handled individually (local execution, sales). The key is making **disciplined choices about when and how to work together**.
