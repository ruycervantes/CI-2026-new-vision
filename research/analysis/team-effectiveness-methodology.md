## Frameworks by Source

### Richi (22 Jan 2026)

#### Three Dimensions (I / Wi / It)

| Dimension | What it means | Key indicators |
|-----------|---------------|----------------|
| **I** (Individual) | Person is inspired by the project, feels it's what they need | Engagement, fit with career moment |
| **Wi** (We) | High trust, psychological safety, no undiscussables | People talk about everything openly |
| **It** (Purpose) | Team has its own purpose beyond company mission | Unique contribution, reason to exist |

#### Three Intervention Tracks

| Track | Foreground | Background | Purpose |
|-------|------------|------------|---------|
| **Offsites** | Philosophy, principles, skills | Business context | Learn frameworks using real business conversations |
| **Meeting Facilitation** | Business | Philosophy | Catch behaviors in flow of work, help honor what they said they wanted |
| **Individual Coaching** | Person | Team context | Build individual skills that enable collective interdependence |

**Richi's language:** Foreground/background flip. In offsites, philosophy is foreground. In facilitation, business is foreground and philosophy becomes the lens.

#### Teams as Culture Cells

- Teams (especially leadership teams) are fundamental cells for culture
- Culture = "how people have to think and act to belong to the group"
- Leaders' behavior sends the strongest messages about culture
- Don't announce rules → model behaviors first, let people ask "what's different?"

### Dolo (21 Jan 2026)

#### HPT = Component Assembly

Key insight: HPT is NOT a separate methodology. It's the assembly of:
- Coaching (same handbook as Leadership Development)
- Teaching/Workshops (same playbook)
- Facilitation (unique skill — Skilled Facilitator framework)

> "La parte de skill building es la misma... tenés que mirarlo distinto, por eso tenés que entender el framework con el que lo estás mirando."

#### Four-Phase Process

| Phase | What happens |
|-------|--------------|
| **Context** | Understand team configuration, objectives, success criteria |
| **Diagnostic** | Team assessment (Lencioni/Katzenbach) + Individual assessment (DISC/LSI/LI) |
| **Interventions** | Workshops, meeting facilitation, group coaching, individual coaching |
| **Tracking** | Self-report, leader conversations, periodic re-measurement |

#### Assessment Frameworks

| Framework | Level | What it measures |
|-----------|-------|------------------|
| **Lencioni (5 Dysfunctions)** | Team | Trust, conflict, commitment, accountability, results |
| **Katzenbach** | Team | 4 dimensions (ownership, commitment, skills, accountability) |
| **Team Pulse** (internal) | Team | Custom dimensions |
| **DISC/LSI/LI** | Individual | Leadership style, behavioral patterns |

**Note:** Axialent is NOT prescriptive. Consultants choose framework based on preference/client.

#### Foreground/Background (same as Richi)

| Mechanism | Content | Philosophy |
|-----------|---------|------------|
| **Workshops** | Foreground | Background |
| **Meeting Facilitation** | Background | Foreground |

#### Trust-First Sequencing

Initial workshops cover:
1. Trust-building
2. Purpose/Why clarification
3. Burning platform (the gap)
4. Individual "why" connected to team "why"
5. Operating agreements

Only AFTER trust → execution skills, accountability.

#### Stewardship Principle

> "Yo creo que tiene que ser human led en general... necesitas el stewardship, necesitas la revisión de que eso tiene sentido."

Don't deploy AI blindly — maintain thoughtful human oversight. Many things CAN be automated:
- Assessment collection
- Pattern analysis
- AI coaching
- Meeting minutes
- Conversation prep

Human stewardship needed for:
- Validation that outputs make sense
- Context interpretation
- Final decisions on interventions
- Meeting facilitation (stays human-led)

#### No Proprietary HPT Framework

Axialent uses public frameworks (Lencioni OR Katzenbach) for team assessment. The differentiation is:
1. CB philosophy applied to teams
2. Consultant judgment in combining components
3. Facilitation skill

### Horacio (22 Jan 2026)

#### 4-Quadrant Model (Axialent HPT)

> "El modelo de cuatro cuadrantes es como la operacionalización del de Katzenbach."

| Quadrant | Focus | Intervention |
|----------|-------|--------------|
| **Purpose/Values/Objectives** | Why the team exists | Mission clarity, goal alignment |
| **Roles & Responsibilities** | Who does what | RACI, accountability |
| **Processes** | How work gets done | Meeting effectiveness, coordination |
| **Relationships** | Quality of conversations | CB skills, trust, psychological safety |

**Key insight:** Relationships quadrant is where CB teaching becomes most relevant.

#### Two Types of Diagnostic

| Type | Instruments | What It Guides |
|------|-------------|----------------|
| **Behavioral** | LSI (individual), OCI (team culture) | What behaviors need to change |
| **Team Functioning** | 4-Quadrant assessment | What the team needs to work on |

These are complementary: 4-Quadrant tells you WHERE; behavioral tells you HOW.

#### Context Shapes Design

Two contexts for HPT:
1. **Standalone team intervention** — full diagnostic, teaching, coaching
2. **Part of culture transformation** — team arrives "pre-warmed," skip foundations

#### Timeline Example (Western Union)

```
Pre-Project → Diagnostic → Launch → Delivery → Ongoing
     ↓            ↓          ↓         ↓          ↓
  Trust-      LSI/OCI/   Kickoff   Offsites   Facilitated
  building   4-Quadrant   meeting   + LSI     meetings
                                   debrief
```

#### Diagnostic Drives Agenda

> "Si en promedio ese equipo contestó que claridad de roles está en 1.5, bueno, claramente eso lo voy a poner como agenda."

Assessment results directly determine what you work on. Low score = that's the focus.

### Oseas (22 Jan 2026)

#### Commercial Framing: Team Performance, Not Coaching

> "Cambia mucho la manera de poder abordar la cuestión comercial si el framing desde el principio es que tenemos una solución que se llama Team Performance."

Individual coaching IS the mechanism. Team Performance is the product. Same work, better positioning.

#### Social Context Increases Adherence

> "Una de las cosas que ayudan a la adhesión del cambio de comportamiento es el entorno social."

- Individual coaching alone: low adherence (like solo dieting)
- Individual coaching in team context: higher adherence (social accountability)
- Team dashboard showing progress: makes individual work visible

#### Quick Win: Team Survey + CB Assessment

Combine existing instruments:
1. Team Survey (4-Quadrant) → WHERE team is broken
2. CB Assessment → Individual patterns
3. Cross-analysis → "Your team is weak on X, you're contributing via Y"

Can prototype with minimal development.

#### Leader-First Pathway

For dysfunctional teams:
1. Coach the leader first
2. Leader gains awareness + skills
3. Leader facilitates basic team conversations
4. Then broader team development

## Theoretical Connections

### Foreground/Background ↔ Activity Theory Levels

Richi's foreground/background maps to activity theory's hierarchy:

| Level | What it is | Visibility |
|-------|------------|------------|
| **Activity** | Cultural, motive-driven | Usually tacit |
| **Action** | Conscious, goal-directed | What you're paying attention to |
| **Operation** | Automatic, condition-driven | Invisible until it breaks |

**The hierarchy is bidirectional:**

```
     Activity (Cultural/Tacit)
            ↑↓
     Action (Conscious/Goal)
            ↑↓
     Operation (Automatic)
```

**Down:** Learning → Practice → Automaticity
- Learn a principle consciously (Action)
- Practice until it becomes automatic (Operation)
- It becomes "how we do things" (Activity/Culture)

**Up:** What Conscious Business specifically does
- Take what's tacit/automatic/cultural (invisible)
- Bring it to consciousness (Action level)
- Now you can examine it, change it, choose differently

**CB's core move is bringing the tacit UP.** You can't change what you can't see. The methodology makes the invisible visible.

**The learning mechanism:**

When something is at the **Operation level** (automatic), you're *subject* to it — you can't see it. To learn/change, you must bring it to **Action level** (conscious) — make it *object* of your analysis.

This is what Richi's tracks do:

| Track | What happens | Activity theory translation |
|-------|--------------|----------------------------|
| **Offsites** | Philosophy is foreground | Cultural level becomes conscious/actionable |
| **Meeting Facilitation** | Automatic behaviors get named | Operations become visible as actions |
| **Individual Coaching** | Reflect on what happened | Make automatic patterns object of analysis |

**Richi's quote (subject-object):**
> "Cuando tú eres sujeto de algo, no lo ves. Para verlo tenés que moverte afuera y hacerlo objeto de tu análisis."

This IS the activity theory move: Operation → Action, Subject → Object.

### Mapping to Ruy's Levels × Temporal Framework

| Richi's Tracks | Temporal | Level | Notes |
|----------------|----------|-------|-------|
| Offsites | Before | Team | Setup, building shared artifacts |
| Meeting Facilitation | During | Team | In the flow of work |
| Individual Coaching | After | Personal | Reflection, skill building |

**What Ruy's framework adds:**
- Explicit **System level** (tools, infrastructure, narratives)
- AI coach operates at System level — enabling infrastructure

**Open question:** Is the System level present in Richi's framing but implicit? (The CB philosophy, the assessment tools, the shared language — these are system-level artifacts)
